        <li>
          <strong>Loss of keys.</strong> A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of Tokens stored in your Wallet. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your Wallet storing Tokens may result in loss of such Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted Wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your Tokens.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hacking activities.</strong> Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the ePayService Platform and Coinly.one or the Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Market risk.</strong> Market value if any of the Tokens are likely to fluctuate unfavorably during or after token transfer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Risks involving cloud storage.</strong> The transactions involving Tokens are susceptible to a number of risks related to the storage of data in the cloud. They may involve the storage of large amounts of sensitive and/or proprietary information, which may be compromised in the event of a cyberattack or other malicious activity. Similarly, Coinly.one may be interrupted, and files may become temporarily unavailable in the event of such an attack or malicious activity. The risk that the ePayService Platform may face increasing interruptions and we may face additional security vulnerabilities could adversely affect the network and therefore the future utility of any Tokens that you hold.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unforeseen risks.</strong> Cryptographic tokens such as the Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition, there are other risks associated with your acquiring, holding and use of Tokens, including those that we cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed herein.
