  <strong class="heading">Changes to the Terms of Use</strong>

  <p>We may revise and update these Terms of Use from time to time at our sole discretion.

  <strong class="heading">Arbitration</strong>

  <p>Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach

    American Arbitration Association (”AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and
    Mediation Procedures (”Commercial Rules”) including, if appropriate, the Procedures for
    Large, Complex Commercial Disputes. Authority of tribunal, judicial review.</p>

  <p>The award rendered by the arbitrators shall be final, non-reviewable, non-appealable
    and binding on the parties and may be entered and enforced in any court having
    jurisdiction. There shall be three arbitrators agreed to by the parties within thirty (30)
    days of receipt by respondents of the request for arbitration or, in default of such
    agreement, by the AAA. The seat or place of arbitration shall be San Mateo, California.
    The arbitration shall be conducted and the award shall be rendered in the english
    language.</p>

  <p>Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor the arbitrators may disclose the
    existence, content or results of any arbitration without the prior written consent of both
    parties, unless to protect or pursue a legal right. The arbitrators will have no authority to
    award punitive damages, consequential damages, or liquidated damages.</p>

  <strong class="heading">Class Actions and Collective Actions</strong>

  <p>The parties expressly agree and intend that:</p>

  <ul class="agreement-list">
    <li>class action and collective action procedures shall not be asserted, and will not
      apply, in any arbitration under this Agreement;</li>
    <li>each will not assert class or collective action claims against the other in
      arbitration, court, or any other forum;</li>
    <li>each shall only submit their own individual claims in arbitration and shall not bring
      claims against the other in any representative capacity on behalf of any other
      individual; and</li>
    <li>any claims by a party will not be joined, consolidated, or heard together with
      claims of any other party.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the AAA Arbitration Rules, and the general
    grant of authority to the arbitrators by this agreement of the power to determine issues
    of arbitrability, the arbitrators shall have no jurisdiction or authority to compel any class
    or collective claim, to consolidate different arbitration proceedings, or to join any other
    party to an arbitration between the parties. The arbitrators shall have the authority to
    determine the enforceability of this class and collective action and arbitration waiver.</p>

    be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any
