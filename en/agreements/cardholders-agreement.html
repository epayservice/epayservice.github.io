        </li>
        <li>
          If available, where you have requested additional Debit Cards, you authorise us to issue such Debit Cards and a PIN and you confirm that each additional Debit Cardholder is approved by you to authorise transactions on your behalf.

    <strong>By using the Debit Card you are agreeing to these terms and conditions.</strong><br><br>
    <li>Funding your Debit Card<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          Your Debit Card can be in USD or EUR; always consider the exchange rates that may apply to transactions in a different currency to the one corresponding to your debit card.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can use your Debit Card to access funds held in your ePayService account. Other types on fund loading are not possible.
        </li>

        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Using your Debit Card<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          Detailed instructions on how to use your Debit Card are found on the website www.epayservices.com. You will need to follow these instructions when using your Debit Card.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will deduct the value of your transactions from the balance on your account as soon as they are made. We will also deduct any applicable fees from your account as soon as they become payable by you. For the list of the applicable fees please see Cardholder Fee Table in section 12.5.1
        </li>
        <li>
          The Debit Card belongs to us. We may ask you to stop using your Debit Card and return it to us or destroy it any time. We may, at any time suspend, restrict or cancel your Debit Card or refuse to issue or replace a Debit Card because:<br>
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. we are concerned about security of your account or Debit Card(s) we have issued to you;<br>
            ii. we suspect your account is being used in an unauthorised or fraudulent manner;<br>
            iii. or we need to do so to comply with the law or request by a government authority.<br>
            If we do this, we will tell you as soon as we can or are permitted to do so after we have taken these steps.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Like other payment cards, we cannot guarantee that a retailer will accept your Debit Card. We may also refuse to pay a transaction:<br>
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. if we are concerned about security of your Debit Card or we suspect your Debit Card is being used in an unauthorised or fraudulent manner;<br>
            ii. If insufficient cleared funds are available via your Debit Card at the time of a transaction to cover the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees;<br>
            iii. if there is an outstanding Shortfall (defined in section 12 below) on the associated ePayService account;<br>
            iv. if we have reasonable grounds to believe that you are acting in breach of this agreement;<br>
            v. if we believe that a transaction is potentially suspicious or illegal (for example, if we believe that a transaction is being made fraudulently); or<br>
            vi. because of errors, failures (whether mechanical or otherwise) or refusals by merchants, payment processors or payment schemes processing transactions.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          If we refuse to authorise a transaction, we will, if practicable, tell you why immediately unless it would be unlawful for us to do so. You may correct any information we hold and which may have caused us to refuse a transaction by contacting us, using the Website.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Authorising Transactions<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          Subject to the features of the particular Debit Card, the authorisation of a transaction can include authorising any single transaction, a series or recurring transactions (including transactions for an indefinite period) or pre-authorising future transactions of a certain or uncertain amount.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Debit Card transaction will be regarded as authorised by you where you;<br>
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. authorise the transaction at the point of sale by following the instructions provided by the merchant or retailer to authorise the transaction, which may include:
            <div style="padding-left:10px">
              (a) entering your PIN or providing any other security code;<br>
              (b) providing the Debit Card details and/ or providing any other details as requested;<br>
              (c) waving or swiping the Debit Card over a card reader
            </div>
            ii. insert a Debit Card and enter your PIN to request a cash withdrawal at an ATM;
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Authorisation for a transaction may not be withdrawn (or revoked) by you after the transaction has been settled with the merchant.
        </li>
        <li>
          A transaction (the payment order) will be received as follows:
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. for purchases and ATM transactions, at the time we receive the transaction instruction from the merchant acquirer or ATM operator;<br>
            ii. for other transactions which are communicated directly to us, at the time you ask us to complete the transaction.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          It is your personal responsibility to ensure you do not spend more than the amount of the funds available in your ePayService account.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you carry out a transaction the company involved will take a âpre-authorisationâ to reserve the amount they intend to collect. Some merchants will pre-authorise a higher or lesser amount than the cost of the transaction. The funds are usually collected from your account when the merchants has requested a settlement for the transaction following completion of the transaction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pre-authorisation reserves the funds from your available balance for a maximum of 10 days. After this time if the monies have not already been collected by the merchant they will be returned to your available balance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Although transactions are pre-authorised at the time an order is placed, for some purchases such as mail order, your account may not be debited until the goods are despatched, which may be longer than 30 days. Therefore you must make allowances for this in your spending to prevent your account falling into negative debit balance. The same would apply to car rental companies who will take a pre-authorisation upon your collection of the rental vehicle but will only debit your account at the end of the hire period.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Cancellation and expiry of your Debit Card<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          This agreement will continue indefinitely unless terminated. You have a legal right to cancel your Debit Card up to 14 days after you receive it. This 14 day period is known as the âCooling Offâ Period. Under these terms and conditions, you also have the right to cancel your Debit Card at any time after the 14 day Cooling Off Period without notice.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may cancel this agreement forthwith:
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. if this agreement or your card expires on a set date and we have not agreed to renew it;<br>
            ii. if you break an important part of this agreement, or repeatedly break the agreement and fail to resolve the matter in a timely manner;<br>
            iii. if you fail to pay fees or charges that you have incurred or fail to put right any Shortfall.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          We may also cancel this agreement or suspend your Card or account immediately if we believe your Debit Card is deliberately being used by you to commit fraud or for other illegal purposes. If we do this we will tell you as soon as we are permitted to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
          If your Debit Card is cancelled, we will immediately block it and any additional cards so that they cannot be used.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will not be entitled to a refund of money you have already spent on transactions authorised, or pending or on any fees for the use of the Debit Card before it is cancelled or expires. You can cancel your Debit Card by creating a ticket in your online account, and confirming that you have destroyed your Debit Card and any additional Cards.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you cancel your Debit Card (and the associated ePayService account) once all transactions and fees have been deducted, we will arrange for any unused funds to be refunded to you, see Your Right to a Refund section below for further information. A Refund Fee may be charged in certain circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your Debit Card will be valid for three years. When it expires, unless we are told otherwise, we may issue you with a replacement Debit card.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Keeping your Debit Card secure<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          You should treat your Debit Card like cash. If it is lost or stolen, you may lose some or all of your money accessible via your Debit Card, in the same way as if you lost cash. You must keep your Debit Card safe and not let anyone else use it. If you are issued with a PIN, you should memorise the PIN, then destroy the notification and keep your PIN secret at all times. You can change your PIN at Chip enabled ATM by following the screen instructions or by logging into your online ePayService account.
        </li>
        <li>
          We recommend that you check the balance on your ePayService regularly online at the website. We will provide you with your balance and a statement of recent transactions on our secure webpage at any time. Your statement will show:

      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          You must notify us by phone or email if your card has been lost or stolen; similarly you must notify if you know or suspect that the PIN or password is known to an unauthorised person or if you think a transaction has been incorrectly executed.

          <ol class="multi">
            <li>
              the transaction was not authorised under this agreement;

              we are responsible for a transaction which was incorrectly executed and you have notified us in accordance with section 8 above;
            </li>
            <li>
              a pre-authorised transaction did not specify the exact amount at the time of its authorisation and the amount charged by a supplier is more than you or an additional Debit Cardholder could reasonably have expected taking into account normal spending patterns on the Debit Card or the circumstances of the transaction;

We reserve the right to change these terms and conditions at shorter notice, provided there is no material change to them or to ensure we accommodate new regulatory requirements or ensure service continuity. The up-to-date version of the Debit Card terms and conditions will always be available on our website. The change will automatically take effect and you will be taken to have accepted the notified change unless you tell us that you do not agree to the change.

    </li>
    <li>Fees & Limits<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          We do not charge any fees to you for checking your on-line balance and transactions on our website https://online.epayservices.com or other mobile applications offered by us. However other fees may apply. For all transactions made in a foreign currency we will charge a currency conversion fee of 1.99%. The rate used for conversion will be based on the Mastercard conversion rate applicable at the time the transaction is processed. Details of Mastercard conversion rates can be found at https://www.mastercard.com/global/currencyconversion/index.html. For more fee details please see the cardholder fee table under 12.5.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we decide to increase or introduce any new fees, we will tell you by e-mail, text, at least 60 days before any changes take effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          Authorisation will be requested for all transactions at the time of each transaction. In the unlikely event, for any reason whatsoever, a transaction is completed when there are insufficient funds for that transaction on the ePayService account associated with the Debit Card (a Shortfall), the Shortfall shall be reimbursed by you unless it is due to an error on the part of the retailer where the Debit Card was presented, in this circumstance we may seek the Shortfall from the retailer.
        </li>
        <li>
          You agree that once we make this Shortfall known to you, we may charge you for the Shortfall amount. We may charge the amount of the shortfall from any other account that you hold with us, to any other payment method which you may designate at that time, or against any funds which you may subsequently load onto your account. Until we are reimbursed the Shortfall amount, we may suspend your Debit Card and any additional Debit Cards or accounts connected to you. In addition, we reserve the right to charge you an Administration Fee for each transaction that you make using your Debit Card that results in a Shortfall or increases the Shortfall amount on your account.
