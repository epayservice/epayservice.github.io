  <p>When	you	call	the	MTACC	Limited,	we	do	not	need	other	information,	other	than	what	is	essential	to
  identify	you	and	ensure	we	are	able	to	help	client’s	queries,	and	on	simple	terms,	speak	to	you.</p>

  <strong class="heading">People	who	email	us</strong>

  <p>Our	emails	are	linked	to	Google	Gmail	for	Business.	More	information	can	be	found	at
    <a href="https://gsuite.google.ru/intl/en/">
      https://gsuite.google.ru/intl/en/
    </a>
  </p>

  <p>Accordingly,	all	security	encrypt solutions	are	on	the	side	of	Google.

      https://gsuite.google.ru/intl/en/security/?secure-by-design_activeEl=data-centers
    </a>
  </p>

  <p>We	will	also	monitor	any	emails	sent	to	us,	including	file	attachments,	for	viruses	or	malicious
  software.	Please	be	aware	that	you	have	a	responsibility	to	ensure	that	any	email	you	send	is	within
  the	bounds	of	the	law.</p>

  <strong class="heading">LiveChat	service</strong>

  <p>We	have	a	LiveChat	solution	from	the German	company	LiveZilla	GmbH
  <a href="https://www.livezilla.net/home/en/">
    https://www.livezilla.net/home/en/
  </a>
  However,	we	have	not	a	cloud	solution	(SaaS),	but	a	"boxed
  version".	This	means	that	we	completely	bought	this	software	and	installed	it	on	your	server	without
  access	to	it	from	LiveZilla	GmbH.	All	history	of conversations	with	data	is	stored	on	our	secure	server
  and	LiveZilla	GmbH	should	not	have	access	to	them.</p>

  <strong class="heading">People	who	make	a	complaint	to	us and	Data	Subject	Access	Requests	(DSAR).</strong>

  <p>When	we	receive	a or	a	DSAR from	a	person	we	make	up	a	file	containing	the	details	of	the
  complaint/request.	This	normally	contains	the	identity	of	the	complainant	and	any	other	individuals
  involved.</p>

  <p>We	will	only	use	the	personal	information	we	collect	to	process	the	complaint	and	to	check	on	the
  level	of	service	we	provide.</p>

  <p>We	will	keep	personal	information	contained	in	complaint	files	in	line	with	our	retention	policy.	This
  means	that	information	relating	to	a	complaint	will	be	retained	for	two	years	from	closure.	It	will	be
  retained	in	a	secure	environment	and	access	to	it	will	be	restricted	according	to	the	‘need	to	know’
  principle.</p>

  <p>Similarly,	where	enquiries	or	DSARs	are	submitted	to	us	we	will	only	use	the	information	supplied	to
  us	to	deal	with	the	enquiry	and	any	subsequent	issues	and	to	check	on	the	level	of	service	we
  provide.</p>

  <strong class="heading">People	who	use	MTACC	Limited services</strong>

  <p>MTACC	Limited offers	various	services	to	the	public. We	use	a	third	party	to	provide	KYC	and
  financial	crime	remediation	services,	provided	by	reputable	third	parties	such	as	WorldCheck.
  We	have	to	hold	the	details	of	the	people	who	have	requested	the	service	in	order	to	provide	it,
  along	with	the	personal	data	of	the	individuals	who	are	being	subjected	to	financial	crime	and/or
  KYC	remediation	services/checks.	We	only	use	these	details	to	provide	the service	the	person	has
  requested.</p>

  <strong class="heading">Service	providers	reporting	a	breach</strong>

  <p>Public	electronic	communications	service	providers	are	required	by	law	to	report	any	security
  breaches	involving	personal	data	to	the	ICO. We	will	advise	if	our	providers,	and	other	service

  <strong class="heading">What	information	do	we	ask	for,	and	why?</strong>

  <p>We	do	not	collect	more	information	than	we	need	to	fulfil	our	stated	purposes	and	will	not	retain	it

  <p>We	ask	you	for	your	personal	details	including	name	and	contact	details.	We	will	also	ask	you	about

  have	applied	for.	Our	HR team	will	have	access	to	all	of	this	information.</p>

  <p>You	will	also	be	asked	to	provide	equal	opportunities	information.	This	is	not	mandatory	information
  – if	you	do not	provide	it,	it	will	not	affect	your	application.	This	information	will	not	be	made
  available	to	any	staff	outside	of	our	recruitment	team,	including	hiring	managers,	in	a	way	which	can
