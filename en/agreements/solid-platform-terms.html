      agreement with Platform. Transactions completed on our website or mobile
      application may include a transaction fee as detailed when you make a
      transaction request.</p>

      <li>Reversals.</li>

      <p>In the event that a sender or the sender’s financial institution requests a
      reversal of payment or Solid decides against you in a dispute against you, we
      reserve the right to charge you a $15.00 fee in addition to the full amount of
      the transaction (collectively, the “Reversal Dues”). You agree to immediately
      reimburse for the Reversal Dues. Additionally, you authorize us to recover any
      Reversal Dues outstanding to Solid or Bank by debiting your available Account
      Balance. If you have an insufficient Account Balance, you authorize Solid and
      our Bank to take any of the following actions to recover the remaining amounts
      from you:</p>
      <p>a. Debit the Bank Account(s) linked to our services;</p>
      <p>b. Suspend your use of our services and require your immediate payment; or</p>
      <p>c. Engage in collection efforts.</p>

      <li>Protecting you and resolving disputes.</li>

      <p>Solid is always looking for ways to protect you from abusive business
      practices, security-related issues, and other issues you may encounter with
      Platform and our Banks. If you have a complaint against how Platform or Bank
      is providing services to you or using your User Data, just let us know by
      emailing us at <strong>legal@solidfi.com</strong> per below. We cannot warranty or guarantee
      anything under this section, but if we are able to help, we will work with you to
      resolve your complaint so long as such assistance is commercially reasonable
      and does not violate any agreements with third parties, regulations, or laws.
      Disputes relating to your Account shall be governed by your specific account
      agreements. Below is more information on how we can try to help you with
      other Disputes (as defined below).</p>

      <strong  class="heading-small">a. Dispute resolution.</strong>

      <p>You understand and agree that we are not responsible for the goods or
      services that you pay for using our services, including but not limited to those
      offered by your Platform and other third parties. Each Platform and seller that
      you purchase from is responsible for providing the goods and services that you
      purchase and for providing all customer service related to those goods and
      services. We recommend that you review Platform’s and, if applicable, a
      seller’s policies before completing your purchase. You are responsible for
      resolving any disputes that you may have with a
      Platform or a seller. If you have exhausted all options for resolving a complaint
      about abusive business practices, security-related issues, or other dispute with
      a Platform or a seller, you may choose to file a dispute claim with Solid
      (“Dispute”) by following the steps in this “Disputes” Section.</p>

      <strong  class="heading-small">b. Release of Solid.</strong>

      <p>By filing a Dispute, you understand and agree that:</p>

      <p>You are asking us to assist in resolving the dispute in its sole discretion and
      that such assistance or Solid’s decision may not be satisfactory to you;</p>

      <p>Solid’s assistance in resolving the dispute does not guarantee any particular
      outcome or any action on our part; and</p>

      <p>You release Solid and our officers, directors, agents, employees, subsidiaries,
      and suppliers from all claims, demands, and damages of any kind arising out of
      your dispute with a seller and Solid’s review of your Dispute.</p>

      <strong  class="heading-small">c. How to file a Dispute.</strong>To file a Dispute, follow these steps:<br>

      <strong  class="heading-small">i. Abusive business practices, security issues, or other non-transactionrelated disputes.</strong> If you have a complaint about a Platform relating to abusive business practices, security issues, handling of your User Data, or related issues, email us at <strong>legal@solidfi.com</strong> with the following information:
      <ol>
        <li>The email associated with your account;</li>

          taken to resolve the issue, and copies of supporting documentation (e.g. email
          correspondence, related agreements, and<br>
          promises or affirmations, etc.); and</li>
        <li>How these issues have negatively affected you.</li>
      </ol>

      <strong  class="heading-small">ii. Transaction-related disputes or unauthorized activity.</strong> Within 45 days of
      the original disputed transaction or immediately if the Dispute relates to
      unauthorized activity, email us at chat@solidfi.com with the following

          available;</li>
        <li>The name of the website, phone application, and Platform relating to such
          Dispute;</li>
        <li>The transaction ID number;</li>
        <li>The amount of the transaction; and</li>
        <li>The details of the unauthorized activity or your disagreement with the
          recipient, including any steps already taken to resolve the issue, and copies of
          supporting documentation (e.g. when you first noticed such unauthorized
          activity, email correspondence, receipts, shipping confirmations, etc.).</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Provide any additional information or documentation that we may request.
      Once Solid has decided the outcome of the Dispute, the parties will be notified

      actions required by such decision.</p>

      <strong class="heading-small">All disputes relating to an Account shall be governed by the specific Account agreement and this section shall not apply.</strong>

      third parties for any and all such liability.</p>

      <strong class="heading-small">b. Actions we may take.</strong>

      <p>If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you may have breached these
      Terms of Service, that you or your account activity presents risk or security
      concerns, or if we are unable to verify your identity, we may take actions to
      protect Solid, Bank, Platforms, our users, or other third parties from Reversal
      Dues, claims, fines, penalties, and any other liability. These actions may
      include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

      <p>i. Suspending your access to your Account or other Solid related services;</p>

If we limit or suspend such accounts, we will provide you with notice of our action.</strong>

      <li>IMPORTANT LEGAL PROVISIONS</li>

      <strong class="heading-small">a. NO WARRANTIES.</strong>

      <p>THE SERVICES UNDER THE TERMS OF SERVICE, Solid’S WEBSITE, AND
      ITS CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS
      WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ALL
      WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF
      TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES’
      RIGHTS, AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>

      <p>THE Solid SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE”,
      WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OF WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS,
      IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. USE OF THE Solid SERVICES IS AT YOUR
      OWN RISK. Solid, BANKS, AND OUR AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS,
      DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, AND SUPPLIERS, SPECIFICALLY
      DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
      FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NEITHER
      Solid NOR BANK HAVE CONTROL OF, OR LIABILITY FOR, ANY
      PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED BY PLATFORMS OR THAT ARE
      PAID FOR USING OUR SERVICES AND CANNOT ENSURE THAT ANY
      PLATFORM OR OTHER THIRD PARTY YOU TRANSACT WITH WILL
      COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION. NEITHER Solid NOR BANK REPRESENT
      OR WARRANT THAT OUR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS,
      BE CONTINUOUS, UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, TIMELY, OR ERRORFREE, OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ADVICE OR
      INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU
      FROM Solid OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY
      WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN. NEITHER Solid NOR
      BANK SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS OR
      SYSTEM FAILURES THAT MAY AFFECT THE PROCESSING,
      COMPLETION, OR SETTLEMENT OF OUR SERVICE TRANSACTIONS.
      THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY SECTION SHALL APPLY TO THE
      FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE
      JURISDICTION</p>

      <p>Solid MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES RELATING TO
      YOUR FUNDS OR ACCOUNT BALANCES INCLUDING FEDERAL
      DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (“FDIC”) INSURANCE
      COVERAGE OR SECURITIES INVESTOR PROTECTION CORPORATION
      (“SPIC”) INSURANCE COVERAGE. SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND
      WARRANTIES MAY BE FOUND IN THE SPECIFIC ACCOUNT
      AGREEMENT OR AGREEMENT WITH YOUR PLATFORM. UNLESS
      NOTIFIED OTHERWISE BY SUCH AGREEMENTS, YOUR ACCOUNT
      BALANCES MAY LOSE VALUE IN THE EVENT BANK OR BROKER
      DEALER ENTERS A RECEIVERSHIP.</p>

      <strong class="heading-small">b. Force majeure.</strong>

      <p>You understand and agree we will not be held responsible for any losses or
      damages resulting from suspension of service due to extraordinary events or
      circumstances beyond our control. In such an event, Solid or Bank may
      suspend the services and access to your Account held by Bank or Platform for
      your benefit.</p>

      <strong class="heading-small">c. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</strong>

      <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
      (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INCIDENTAL, AND CONSEQUENTIAL
      DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST DATA
      OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) RESULTING FROM THE USE OR
      INABILITY TO USE Solid’S, BANK’S, PLATFORM’S SERVICES OR
      WEBSITES OR PHONE APPLICATIONS OR CONTENT THEREIN
      WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
      NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF WE HAVE
      BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME
      STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR
      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
      DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT
      APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH STATES, OUR LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO
      THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

      <strong class="heading-small">d. Indemnification.</strong>

      <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Solid and their respective
      officers, directors, employees, agents, and suppliers (collectively “Disclaiming
      Entities”) from and against any third party claim, suit, demand, loss, liability,
      damage, action, proceeding or suits and related liabilities, damages,
      settlements, penalties, fines, costs or expenses (including reasonable
      attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses) arising out of or relating to (i)
      your breach of any provision of these Terms of Service; (ii) your actions and
      omissions in connection with your accounts or our services; (iii) our actions
      and omissions, provided that they are taken/omitted in accordance with this
      Terms of Service or your instructions; or (iv) your violation of any laws and
      regulations; or (v) your negligent or reckless act or omission or willful
      misconduct of your employees, contractors, or agents. This provision shall
      survive the termination of these Terms of Service.</p>

      <strong class="heading-small">e. Binding Arbitration.</strong>

      <p>Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service,
      or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the
      American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration
      Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered
      in any court having jurisdiction thereof. In any arbitration arising out of or
      related to the Terms of Service, the arbitrators will award to the prevailing
      party, if any, the costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the
      prevailing party in connection with those aspects of its claims or defenses on
      which it prevails, and any opposing awards of costs and attorneys’ fees
      awards will be offset.<br>
      No class actions or similar process, and no joinder or consolidation of any
      claim with a claim of any other person or entity, shall be allowable in
      arbitration, without the written consent of both parties. The arbitrator shall have
      no authority to entertain any claim on behalf of a class, group, person, or entity
      who is not a named party to the arbitration, nor shall any arbitrator have
      authority to make any award for the benefit of, or against, any class, group,
      person, or entity who is not a named party to the arbitration. In the event that
      there is a dispute about whether limiting arbitration to non-class proceedings,
      or to the named parties, is enforceable under applicable law, then that
      question shall be resolved by a court rather than by an arbitrator, and to the
      extent, it is determined that resolution of a claim must proceed on a class
      basis, it shall so proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction rather than in
      arbitration.</p>

      <p>The place of arbitration shall be San Francisco, CA, except to the extent, the
      arbitration involves Bank and/or your Account, or a third-party service provider
      of Solid as a party to the dispute, then Solid may in its sole discretion move
      the place of arbitration to the location of such arbitration proceedings to which
      you have previously agreed to in such agreements (See, your specific Account
      Agreement Arbitration sections for more information of the place of
      arbitration).</p>

      <strong class="heading-small">
        ARBITRATION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM IS BINDING AND NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE THAT CLAIM THROUGH A COURT. IN ARBITRATION THE PARTIES WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS THAT APPLY IN COURT, SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JUDGE OR JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE OR BE REPRESENTED IN PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY OTHERS SUCH AS CLASS ACTIONS OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY AND THE RIGHT TO APPEAL MAY ALSO BE LIMITED OR ELIMINATED IN ARBITRATION. ALL OF THESE JUDICIAL RIGHTS ARE WAIVED WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE PARTIES ELECT TO ARBITRATE.
      </strong>

      <p>All claims, findings, and settlements under this “Binding Arbitration” shall be
        confidential information of Solid. You shall not disclose or reveal to
        employees, agents, Platform, or other third parties unless such information is
        already publicly available. Due to the unique nature of the confidential
        information, monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate us for
        your violation or threatened violation may cause irreparable injury to us and,
        in addition to any other remedies that may be available, in law, in equity or
        otherwise, we shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief against the threatened
        breach of confidentiality or the continuation of any such breach by you.</p>

      <li>Other legal terms.</li>

      <p>
        The Terms of Service are governed by the laws of the State of California. You
        agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state and federal
        courts in the State of California except as detailed in the “Binding Arbitration”
        Section. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be invalid by a
        competent court, the invalidity of such provisions shall not affect the validity of
        the remaining provisions. Likewise, if we choose to terminate any provision in
        accordance with the termination provision, that termination shall not affect the
        termination of other provisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we fail to act on or enforce, any provision in the Terms of Service, this shall
        not be construed as a waiver of that, or any other, provision. We will only grant
        waivers to specific provisions, for specific instances, in writing. The Terms of
        Service constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to
        this website and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements.
        The section headings are merely provided for convenience and shall not be
        given any legal import. You may not assign your rights and obligations under
        these Terms of Service. The Terms of Service will inure to the benefit of our
        successors, assignees, licensees, and sublicensees.
