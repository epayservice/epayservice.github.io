        <li>
          It is your responsibility to keep your Account identification, secure identification, password, security questions and answers and other information specific to your Account confidential and in a safe and secure place. This includes ensuring the on-going security of your log-in details on your personal computer device for accessing the Internet. Should another person gain access to your Account by passing all identification and security validation and verification checks, we may at our discretion treat any transaction conducted by that person as valid and are not responsible under any circumstances for any loss or damage you may incur as a result.<br>

          <p>If you think that you have lost your password, Account details, or that they have been compromised, stolen, or that someone has been using your Account without your permission, you must notify Us immediately through our email support form or by using the telephone number provided in these Terms of Use.</p>

MTACC does not provide any warranties, representations, conditions or guarantees with respect to such goods and services.
        </li>

        <li>
          You are fully responsible for the instructions you give MTACC and as a result we may not be able to detect errors in your payment instructions.

          <p>In the event of an unauthorised, non-executed or incorrectly executed transfer, you must let Us know without undue delay on becoming aware of any such transfer. You are only entitled to redress if you notify Us without undue delay, and in any case no later than 13 months after the debit date, provided that we have provided or made available the required transaction information to you. Where you are entitled to redress, we will refund the amount of any unauthorised, non-executed or defective transfer and, where applicable, restore your account to the state it would have been in had the unauthorised transfer not taken place.</p>

          <p>
            Notwithstanding the above, we may, at our discretion, suspend or limit access to your Account (including without limitation, placing a hold on funds in your Account, limiting your ability to send or redeem, transfer or withdraw electronic money from your Account, limiting your payment sources) or close your Account, at any time, in any of the following circumstances:
