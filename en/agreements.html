    <li>Using your Debit Card<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          Detailed instructions on how to use your Debit Card are found on the website www.epayservices.com. You will need to follow these instructions when using your Debit Card.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will deduct the value of your transactions from the balance on your account as soon as they are made. We will also deduct any applicable fees from your account as soon as they become payable by you. For the list of the applicable fees please see Cardholder Fee Table in section 12.5.1
        </li>
        <li>
          The Debit Card belongs to us. We may ask you to stop using your Debit Card and return it to us or destroy it any time. We may, at any time suspend, restrict or cancel your Debit Card or refuse to issue or replace a Debit Card because:<br>
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. we are concerned about security of your account or Debit Card(s) we have issued to you;<br>
            ii. we suspect your account is being used in an unauthorised or fraudulent manner;<br>
            iii. or we need to do so to comply with the law or request by a government authority.<br>
            If we do this, we will tell you as soon as we can or are permitted to do so after we have taken these steps.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Like other payment cards, we cannot guarantee that a retailer will accept your Debit Card. We may also refuse to pay a transaction:<br>
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. if we are concerned about security of your Debit Card or we suspect your Debit Card is being used in an unauthorised or fraudulent manner;<br>
            ii. If insufficient cleared funds are available via your Debit Card at the time of a transaction to cover the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees;<br>
            iii. if there is an outstanding Shortfall (defined in section 12 below) on the associated ePayService account;<br>
            iv. if we have reasonable grounds to believe that you are acting in breach of this agreement;<br>
            v. if we believe that a transaction is potentially suspicious or illegal (for example, if we believe that a transaction is being made fraudulently); or<br>
            vi. because of errors, failures (whether mechanical or otherwise) or refusals by merchants, payment processors or payment schemes processing transactions.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          If we refuse to authorise a transaction, we will, if practicable, tell you why immediately unless it would be unlawful for us to do so. You may correct any information we hold and which may have caused us to refuse a transaction by contacting us, using the Website.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Authorising Transactions<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          Subject to the features of the particular Debit Card, the authorisation of a transaction can include authorising any single transaction, a series or recurring transactions (including transactions for an indefinite period) or pre-authorising future transactions of a certain or uncertain amount.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Debit Card transaction will be regarded as authorised by you where you;<br>
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. authorise the transaction at the point of sale by following the instructions provided by the merchant or retailer to authorise the transaction, which may include:
            <div style="padding-left:10px">
              (a) entering your PIN or providing any other security code;<br>
              (b) providing the Debit Card details and/ or providing any other details as requested;<br>
              (c) waving or swiping the Debit Card over a card reader
            </div>
            ii. insert a Debit Card and enter your PIN to request a cash withdrawal at an ATM;
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Authorisation for a transaction may not be withdrawn (or revoked) by you after the transaction has been settled with the merchant.
        </li>
        <li>
          A transaction (the payment order) will be received as follows:
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. for purchases and ATM transactions, at the time we receive the transaction instruction from the merchant acquirer or ATM operator;<br>
            ii. for other transactions which are communicated directly to us, at the time you ask us to complete the transaction.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          It is your personal responsibility to ensure you do not spend more than the amount of the funds available in your ePayService account.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you carry out a transaction the company involved will take a ‘pre-authorisation’ to reserve the amount they intend to collect. Some merchants will pre-authorise a higher or lesser amount than the cost of the transaction. The funds are usually collected from your account when the merchants has requested a settlement for the transaction following completion of the transaction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pre-authorisation reserves the funds from your available balance for a maximum of 10 days. After this time if the monies have not already been collected by the merchant they will be returned to your available balance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Although transactions are pre-authorised at the time an order is placed, for some purchases such as mail order, your account may not be debited until the goods are despatched, which may be longer than 30 days. Therefore you must make allowances for this in your spending to prevent your account falling into negative debit balance. The same would apply to car rental companies who will take a pre-authorisation upon your collection of the rental vehicle but will only debit your account at the end of the hire period.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Cancellation and expiry of your Debit Card<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          This agreement will continue indefinitely unless terminated. You have a legal right to cancel your Debit Card up to 14 days after you receive it. This 14 day period is known as the ‘Cooling Off’ Period. Under these terms and conditions, you also have the right to cancel your Debit Card at any time after the 14 day Cooling Off Period without notice.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may cancel this agreement forthwith:
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. if this agreement or your card expires on a set date and we have not agreed to renew it;<br>
            ii. if you break an important part of this agreement, or repeatedly break the agreement and fail to resolve the matter in a timely manner;<br>
            iii. if you fail to pay fees or charges that you have incurred or fail to put right any Shortfall.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          We may also cancel this agreement or suspend your Card or account immediately if we believe your Debit Card is deliberately being used by you to commit fraud or for other illegal purposes. If we do this we will tell you as soon as we are permitted to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
          If your Debit Card is cancelled, we will immediately block it and any additional cards so that they cannot be used.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will not be entitled to a refund of money you have already spent on transactions authorised, or pending or on any fees for the use of the Debit Card before it is cancelled or expires. You can cancel your Debit Card by creating a ticket in your online account, and confirming that you have destroyed your Debit Card and any additional Cards.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you cancel your Debit Card (and the associated ePayService account) once all transactions and fees have been deducted, we will arrange for any unused funds to be refunded to you, see Your Right to a Refund section below for further information. A Refund Fee may be charged in certain circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your Debit Card will be valid for three years. When it expires, unless we are told otherwise, we may issue you with a replacement Debit card.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Keeping your Debit Card secure<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          You should treat your Debit Card like cash. If it is lost or stolen, you may lose some or all of your money accessible via your Debit Card, in the same way as if you lost cash. You must keep your Debit Card safe and not let anyone else use it. If you are issued with a PIN, you should memorise the PIN, then destroy the notification and keep your PIN secret at all times. You can change your PIN at Chip enabled ATM by following the screen instructions or by logging into your online ePayService account.
        </li>
        <li>
          We recommend that you check the balance on your ePayService regularly online at the website. We will provide you with your balance and a statement of recent transactions on our secure webpage at any time. Your statement will show:
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. information relating to each Debit Card transaction which will enable it to be identified;<br>
            ii. the amount of the Debit Card transaction shown in the currency in which the transaction was paid or debited to the account;<br>
            iii. the amount of charges for the transaction;<br>
            iv. the date the transaction is authorised or posted on to the account.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Lost and stolen Debit Cards and unauthorised or incorrectly executed payments<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          You must notify us by phone or email if your card has been lost or stolen; similarly you must notify if you know or suspect that the PIN or password is known to an unauthorised person or if you think a transaction has been incorrectly executed. If you believe a transaction on your card is fraudulent, you can report to us up to 13 months after the transaction is processed. The helpline number to report any issues related to your card is +44 (20) 81-3333-12.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provided you notify us promptly and you have not acted fraudulently or with gross negligence we will refund the amount of transaction which our investigations show are not authorised by you.
        </li>
        <li>
          However, if our investigations show that any disputed transaction was authorised by you, or you have acted fraudulently or with gross negligence (for example by failing to keep your Debit Card or PIN secure), you may be liable for any loss or misuse of the Card.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Our liability<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          We shall not be liable to you for any loss of profit or loss of revenue which in each case arises out of or in connection with: (i) this agreement or (ii) any breach or non-performance of this agreement, in each case no matter how fundamental (including by reason of Our negligence) or (iii) temporary or permanent inability to use your Debit Card for any reasons.
        </li>
        <li>
          We shall not be liable to you for:<br>
          <ol class="multi">
            <li>
              any loss of goodwill, reputation or opportunity; or
            </li>
            <li>
              any loss of or corruption of data; or
            </li>
            <li>
              any loss of anticipated savings in each of the foregoing whether direct or indirect; or
            </li>
            <li>
              any indirect or consequential loss, which in each case arises out of or in connection with this agreement or any breach or nonperformance of this agreement no matter how fundamental (including by reason of Our negligence).
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Our total liability arising under or in connection with this agreement or any breach or nonperformance of this agreement no matter how fundamental in contract, tort or otherwise shall be limited to the sums received by Us in aggregate under this agreement in the 12 months preceding the act or omission giving rise to the liability.
        </li>
        <li>
          We shall not guarantee 100% that your card will be accepted by every merchant. Your card acceptance will depend on each merchant’s own card acceptance rules and conditions. We will try to help cardholders with any card acceptance issues, however we will not be liable for any acceptance issues.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Refunding Transactions<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          You will be entitled to claim a refund in relation to transactions where:<br>
          <ol class="multi">
            <li>
              the transaction was not authorised under this agreement;
            </li>
            <li>
              we are responsible for a transaction which was incorrectly executed and you have notified us in accordance with section 8 above;
            </li>
            <li>
              a pre-authorised transaction did not specify the exact amount at the time of its authorisation and the amount charged by a supplier is more than you or an additional Debit Cardholder could reasonably have expected taking into account normal spending patterns on the Debit Card or the circumstances of the transaction;
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p style="padding-left:20px">
        We may change these terms at any time by notifying you by e-mail or other methods agreed, with at least 60 days before the change is due to take effect. We reserve the right to change these terms and conditions at shorter notice, provided there is no material change to them or to ensure we accommodate new regulatory requirements or ensure service continuity. The up-to-date version of the Debit Card terms and conditions will always be available on our website. The change will automatically take effect and you will be taken to have accepted the notified change unless you tell us that you do not agree to the change. In that event, we will treat that notice as notification that you wish immediately to terminate.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>Fees & Limits<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          We do not charge any fees to you for checking your on-line balance and transactions on our website https://online.epayservices.com or other mobile applications offered by us. However other fees may apply. For all transactions made in a foreign currency we will charge a currency conversion fee of 1.99%. The rate used for conversion will be based on the Mastercard conversion rate applicable at the time the transaction is processed. Details of Mastercard conversion rates can be found at https://www.mastercard.com/global/currencyconversion/index.html. For more fee details please see the cardholder fee table under 12.5.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we decide to increase or introduce any new fees, we will tell you by e-mail, text, at least 60 days before any changes take effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          Authorisation will be requested for all transactions at the time of each transaction. In the unlikely event, for any reason whatsoever, a transaction is completed when there are insufficient funds for that transaction on the ePayService account associated with the Debit Card (a Shortfall), the Shortfall shall be reimbursed by you unless it is due to an error on the part of the retailer where the Debit Card was presented, in this circumstance we may seek the Shortfall from the retailer.
        </li>
        <li>
          You agree that once we make this Shortfall known to you, we may charge you for the Shortfall amount. We may charge the amount of the shortfall from any other account that you hold with us, to any other payment method which you may designate at that time, or against any funds which you may subsequently load onto your account. Until we are reimbursed the Shortfall amount, we may suspend your Debit Card and any additional Debit Cards or accounts connected to you. In addition, we reserve the right to charge you an Administration Fee for each transaction that you make using your Debit Card that results in a Shortfall or increases the Shortfall amount on your account.

      <li>Our services.</li>

      <p>Solid provides software services to you and Platforms to give you the ability to
      send and receive funds from third parties, in addition, to open up an Account.
      All funds transfer services are provided by Bank, as Solid does not receive,
      hold, or transmit funds. Our software allows you to send funds transfer
      instructions to Bank. Any funds balance displayed by Solid’s software are held
      in your Account, or otherwise held by Bank or Platform for your benefit, as
      applicable (“Account Balance”).</p>

      <p>Solid MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES RELATING TO
      YOUR FUNDS OR ACCOUNT BALANCES INCLUDING FEDERAL DEPOSIT
      INSURANCE CORPORATION (“FDIC”) INSURANCE COVERAGE. SUCH
      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MAY BE FOUND IN YOUR
      SPECIFIC ACCOUNT AGREEMENT OR AGREEMENT WITH YOUR
      PLATFORM. UNLESS NOTIFIED OTHERWISE BY SUCH AGREEMENTS,
      YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCES MAY LOSE VALUE IN THE EVENT BANK,
      THE BROKER-DEALER, OR PLATFORM ENTERS A RECEIVERSHIP.</p>

      <strong  class="heading-small">a. Bank account services.</strong>

      <p>We provide software services to facilitate your requests for services relating to
      your Account as detailed in such agreements. We are not responsible or liable
      if your request for such services is limited, delayed, or denied for risk,
      compliance, or other reasons.</p>

      <strong  class="heading-small">b. Transaction-only services.</strong>

      <p>As an agent of a Bank, we may provide you with services to process
      transactions to or from your Platform or a third party in addition to your
      Account. In certain circumstances relating to our transaction services, your
      funds may be held by Platform or Bank for your benefit and an account balance
      may be displayed to you by our software. To provide services under this
      section, we may collect personally identifiable information, your Bank Account
      login credentials or account and routing numbers for your Bank Account, or
      other User Data information as we may request from time to time as further
      detailed in these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy. Transactions
      processed via Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) will be processed in
      accordance with such timeframes except as otherwise noted in these Terms of
      Service. Such transaction services may be limited, delayed, or denied for risk
      and compliance reasons that we may not be able to disclose to you. You
      understand that the transactions may be limited, delayed, or denied and
      expressly disclaim any claims relating to such actions. We are not responsible
      for reviewing the accuracy of the transactions (amount, date, or the sender or
      receiver of funds). Additionally, we are not responsible if the receiver of funds
      rejects your transaction.</p>

      <strong  class="heading-small">c. Other services.</strong>

      <p>We may from time to time offer additional services or remove services without
      prior notice to you. You agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of such
      services as they may be offered to you.</p>

      <li>Fees.</li>

      <p>Fees for services offered under your Account are detailed in the specific
      Account agreements. If you use our Transaction services listed in Section 4(b),
      you may be charged a transaction fee by Platform or us as detailed in your
      agreement with Platform. Transactions completed on our website or mobile
      application may include a transaction fee as detailed when you make a
      transaction request.</p>

      <li>Reversals.</li>

      <p>In the event that a sender or the sender’s financial institution requests a
      reversal of payment or Solid decides against you in a dispute against you, we
      reserve the right to charge you a $15.00 fee in addition to the full amount of
      the transaction (collectively, the “Reversal Dues”). You agree to immediately
      reimburse for the Reversal Dues. Additionally, you authorize us to recover any
      Reversal Dues outstanding to Solid or Bank by debiting your available Account
      Balance. If you have an insufficient Account Balance, you authorize Solid and
      our Bank to take any of the following actions to recover the remaining amounts
      from you:</p>
      <p>a. Debit the Bank Account(s) linked to our services;</p>
      <p>b. Suspend your use of our services and require your immediate payment; or</p>

      <li>Protecting you and resolving disputes.</li>

      <p>Solid is always looking for ways to protect you from abusive business
      practices, security-related issues, and other issues you may encounter with
      Platform and our Banks. If you have a complaint against how Platform or Bank
      is providing services to you or using your User Data, just let us know by
      emailing us at <strong>legal@solidfi.com</strong> per below. We cannot warranty or guarantee
      anything under this section, but if we are able to help, we will work with you to
      resolve your complaint so long as such assistance is commercially reasonable
      and does not violate any agreements with third parties, regulations, or laws.
      Disputes relating to your Account shall be governed by your specific account
      agreements. Below is more information on how we can try to help you with
      other Disputes (as defined below).</p>

      <strong  class="heading-small">a. Dispute resolution.</strong>

      <p>You understand and agree that we are not responsible for the goods or
      services that you pay for using our services, including but not limited to those
      offered by your Platform and other third parties. Each Platform and seller that
      you purchase from is responsible for providing the goods and services that you
      purchase and for providing all customer service related to those goods and
      services. We recommend that you review Platform’s and, if applicable, a
      seller’s policies before completing your purchase. You are responsible for
      resolving any disputes that you may have with a
      Platform or a seller. If you have exhausted all options for resolving a complaint
      about abusive business practices, security-related issues, or other dispute with
      a Platform or a seller, you may choose to file a dispute claim with Solid
      (“Dispute”) by following the steps in this “Disputes” Section.</p>

      <p>By filing a Dispute, you understand and agree that:</p>

      <p>You are asking us to assist in resolving the dispute in its sole discretion and
      that such assistance or Solid’s decision may not be satisfactory to you;</p>

      <p>Solid’s assistance in resolving the dispute does not guarantee any particular
      outcome or any action on our part; and</p>

      <p>You release Solid and our officers, directors, agents, employees, subsidiaries,
      and suppliers from all claims, demands, and damages of any kind arising out of
      your dispute with a seller and Solid’s review of your Dispute.</p>

      <strong  class="heading-small">c. How to file a Dispute.</strong>To file a Dispute, follow these steps:<br>

      <strong  class="heading-small">i.

      <p>THE SERVICES UNDER THE TERMS OF SERVICE, Solid’S WEBSITE, AND
      ITS CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS
      WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ALL
      WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF
      TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES’
      RIGHTS, AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>

      <p>THE Solid SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE”,
      WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OF WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS,
      IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. USE OF THE Solid SERVICES IS AT YOUR
      OWN RISK. Solid, BANKS, AND OUR AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS,
      DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, AND SUPPLIERS, SPECIFICALLY
      DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
      FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NEITHER
      Solid NOR BANK HAVE CONTROL OF, OR LIABILITY FOR, ANY
      PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED BY PLATFORMS OR THAT ARE
      PAID FOR USING OUR SERVICES AND CANNOT ENSURE THAT ANY
      PLATFORM OR OTHER THIRD PARTY YOU TRANSACT WITH WILL

      INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU
      FROM Solid OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY
      WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN. NEITHER Solid NOR
      BANK SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS OR
      SYSTEM FAILURES THAT MAY AFFECT THE PROCESSING,
      COMPLETION, OR SETTLEMENT OF OUR SERVICE TRANSACTIONS.
      THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY SECTION SHALL APPLY TO THE
      FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE
      JURISDICTION</p>

      <p>Solid MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES RELATING TO
      YOUR FUNDS OR ACCOUNT BALANCES INCLUDING FEDERAL
      DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (“FDIC”) INSURANCE
      COVERAGE OR SECURITIES INVESTOR PROTECTION CORPORATION
      (“SPIC”) INSURANCE COVERAGE. SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND
      WARRANTIES MAY BE FOUND IN THE SPECIFIC ACCOUNT
      AGREEMENT OR AGREEMENT WITH YOUR PLATFORM. UNLESS
      NOTIFIED OTHERWISE BY SUCH AGREEMENTS, YOUR ACCOUNT
      BALANCES MAY LOSE VALUE IN THE EVENT BANK OR BROKER

      <strong class="heading-small">b. Force majeure.</strong>

      <p>You understand and agree we will not be held responsible for any losses or
      damages resulting from suspension of service due to extraordinary events or
      circumstances beyond our control. In such an event, Solid or Bank may
      suspend the services and access to your Account held by Bank or Platform for
      your benefit.</p>

      <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
      (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INCIDENTAL, AND CONSEQUENTIAL

      WEBSITES OR PHONE APPLICATIONS OR CONTENT THEREIN
      WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
      NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF WE HAVE
      BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME
      STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR
      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
      DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT
      APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH STATES, OUR LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO
      THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

      <strong class="heading-small">d. Indemnification.</strong>

      <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Solid and their respective
      officers, directors, employees, agents, and suppliers (collectively “Disclaiming
      Entities”) from and against any third party claim, suit, demand, loss, liability,
      damage, action, proceeding or suits and related liabilities, damages,
      settlements, penalties, fines, costs or expenses (including reasonable
      attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses) arising out of or relating to (i)
      your breach of any provision of these Terms of Service; (ii) your actions and
      omissions in connection with your accounts or our services; (iii) our actions
      and omissions, provided that they are taken/omitted in accordance with this
      Terms of Service or your instructions; or (iv) your violation of any laws and
      regulations; or (v) your negligent or reckless act or omission or willful
      misconduct of your employees, contractors, or agents. This provision shall
      survive the termination of these Terms of Service.</p>

      <strong class="heading-small">e. Binding Arbitration.</strong>

      <p>Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service,
      or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the
      American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration
      Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered
      in any court having jurisdiction thereof. In any arbitration arising out of or
      related to the Terms of Service, the arbitrators will award to the prevailing
      party, if any, the costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the
      prevailing party in connection with those aspects of its claims or defenses on
      which it prevails, and any opposing awards of costs and attorneys’ fees
      awards will be offset.<br>
      No class actions or similar process, and no joinder or consolidation of any
      claim with a claim of any other person or entity, shall be allowable in
      arbitration, without the written consent of both parties. The arbitrator shall have
      no authority to entertain any claim on behalf of a class, group, person, or entity
      who is not a named party to the arbitration, nor shall any arbitrator have
      authority to make any award for the benefit of, or against, any class, group,
      person, or entity who is not a named party to the arbitration. In the event that
      there is a dispute about whether limiting arbitration to non-class proceedings,
      or to the named parties, is enforceable under applicable law, then that
      question shall be resolved by a court rather than by an arbitrator, and to the
      extent, it is determined that resolution of a claim must proceed on a class
      basis, it shall so proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction rather than in
      arbitration.</p>

      <p>The place of arbitration shall be San Francisco, CA, except to the extent, the
      arbitration involves Bank and/or your Account, or a third-party service provider
      of Solid as a party to the dispute, then Solid may in its sole discretion move
      the place of arbitration to the location of such arbitration proceedings to which
      you have previously agreed to in such agreements (See, your specific Account
      Agreement Arbitration sections for more information of the place of
      arbitration).</p>

      <strong class="heading-small">
        ARBITRATION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM IS BINDING AND NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE THAT CLAIM THROUGH A COURT. IN ARBITRATION THE PARTIES WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS THAT APPLY IN COURT, SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JUDGE OR JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE OR BE REPRESENTED IN PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY OTHERS SUCH AS CLASS ACTIONS OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY AND THE RIGHT TO APPEAL MAY ALSO BE LIMITED OR ELIMINATED IN ARBITRATION. ALL OF THESE JUDICIAL RIGHTS ARE WAIVED WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE PARTIES ELECT TO ARBITRATE.
      </strong>

      <p>All claims, findings, and settlements under this “Binding Arbitration” shall be
        confidential information of Solid. You shall not disclose or reveal to
        employees, agents, Platform, or other third parties unless such information is
        already publicly available. Due to the unique nature of the confidential
        information, monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate us for
        your violation or threatened violation may cause irreparable injury to us and,
        in addition to any other remedies that may be available, in law, in equity or
        otherwise, we shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief against the threatened
        breach of confidentiality or the continuation of any such breach by you.</p>

      <li>Other legal terms.</li>

      <p>
        The Terms of Service are governed by the laws of the State of California. You
        agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state and federal
        courts in the State of California except as detailed in the “Binding Arbitration”
        Section. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be invalid by a
        competent court, the invalidity of such provisions shall not affect the validity of
        the remaining provisions. Likewise, if we choose to terminate any provision in
        accordance with the termination provision, that termination shall not affect the
        termination of other provisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we fail to act on or enforce, any provision in the Terms of Service, this shall
        not be construed as a waiver of that, or any other, provision. We will only grant
        waivers to specific provisions, for specific instances, in writing. The Terms of
        Service constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to
        this website and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements.
        The section headings are merely provided for convenience and shall not be
        given any legal import. You may not assign your rights and obligations under
        these Terms of Service. The Terms of Service will inure to the benefit of our
        successors, assignees, licensees, and sublicensees.
