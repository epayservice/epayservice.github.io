    <li>Using your Debit Card<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          Detailed instructions on how to use your Debit Card are found on the website www.epayservices.com. You will need to follow these instructions when using your Debit Card.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will deduct the value of your transactions from the balance on your account as soon as they are made. We will also deduct any applicable fees from your account as soon as they become payable by you. For the list of the applicable fees please see Cardholder Fee Table in section 12.5.1
        </li>
        <li>
          The Debit Card belongs to us. We may ask you to stop using your Debit Card and return it to us or destroy it any time. We may, at any time suspend, restrict or cancel your Debit Card or refuse to issue or replace a Debit Card because:<br>
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. we are concerned about security of your account or Debit Card(s) we have issued to you;<br>
            ii. we suspect your account is being used in an unauthorised or fraudulent manner;<br>
            iii. or we need to do so to comply with the law or request by a government authority.<br>
            If we do this, we will tell you as soon as we can or are permitted to do so after we have taken these steps.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Like other payment cards, we cannot guarantee that a retailer will accept your Debit Card. We may also refuse to pay a transaction:<br>
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. if we are concerned about security of your Debit Card or we suspect your Debit Card is being used in an unauthorised or fraudulent manner;<br>
            ii. If insufficient cleared funds are available via your Debit Card at the time of a transaction to cover the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees;<br>
            iii. if there is an outstanding Shortfall (defined in section 12 below) on the associated ePayService account;<br>
            iv. if we have reasonable grounds to believe that you are acting in breach of this agreement;<br>
            v. if we believe that a transaction is potentially suspicious or illegal (for example, if we believe that a transaction is being made fraudulently); or<br>
            vi. because of errors, failures (whether mechanical or otherwise) or refusals by merchants, payment processors or payment schemes processing transactions.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          If we refuse to authorise a transaction, we will, if practicable, tell you why immediately unless it would be unlawful for us to do so. You may correct any information we hold and which may have caused us to refuse a transaction by contacting us, using the Website.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Authorising Transactions<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          Subject to the features of the particular Debit Card, the authorisation of a transaction can include authorising any single transaction, a series or recurring transactions (including transactions for an indefinite period) or pre-authorising future transactions of a certain or uncertain amount.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Debit Card transaction will be regarded as authorised by you where you;<br>
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. authorise the transaction at the point of sale by following the instructions provided by the merchant or retailer to authorise the transaction, which may include:
            <div style="padding-left:10px">
              (a) entering your PIN or providing any other security code;<br>
              (b) providing the Debit Card details and/ or providing any other details as requested;<br>
              (c) waving or swiping the Debit Card over a card reader
            </div>
            ii. insert a Debit Card and enter your PIN to request a cash withdrawal at an ATM;
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          Authorisation for a transaction may not be withdrawn (or revoked) by you after the transaction has been settled with the merchant.
        </li>
        <li>
          A transaction (the payment order) will be received as follows:
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. for purchases and ATM transactions, at the time we receive the transaction instruction from the merchant acquirer or ATM operator;<br>
            ii. for other transactions which are communicated directly to us, at the time you ask us to complete the transaction.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          It is your personal responsibility to ensure you do not spend more than the amount of the funds available in your ePayService account.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you carry out a transaction the company involved will take a ‘pre-authorisation’ to reserve the amount they intend to collect. Some merchants will pre-authorise a higher or lesser amount than the cost of the transaction. The funds are usually collected from your account when the merchants has requested a settlement for the transaction following completion of the transaction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pre-authorisation reserves the funds from your available balance for a maximum of 10 days. After this time if the monies have not already been collected by the merchant they will be returned to your available balance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Although transactions are pre-authorised at the time an order is placed, for some purchases such as mail order, your account may not be debited until the goods are despatched, which may be longer than 30 days. Therefore you must make allowances for this in your spending to prevent your account falling into negative debit balance. The same would apply to car rental companies who will take a pre-authorisation upon your collection of the rental vehicle but will only debit your account at the end of the hire period.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Cancellation and expiry of your Debit Card<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          This agreement will continue indefinitely unless terminated. You have a legal right to cancel your Debit Card up to 14 days after you receive it. This 14 day period is known as the ‘Cooling Off’ Period. Under these terms and conditions, you also have the right to cancel your Debit Card at any time after the 14 day Cooling Off Period without notice.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may cancel this agreement forthwith:
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. if this agreement or your card expires on a set date and we have not agreed to renew it;<br>
            ii. if you break an important part of this agreement, or repeatedly break the agreement and fail to resolve the matter in a timely manner;<br>
            iii. if you fail to pay fees or charges that you have incurred or fail to put right any Shortfall.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          We may also cancel this agreement or suspend your Card or account immediately if we believe your Debit Card is deliberately being used by you to commit fraud or for other illegal purposes. If we do this we will tell you as soon as we are permitted to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
          If your Debit Card is cancelled, we will immediately block it and any additional cards so that they cannot be used.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will not be entitled to a refund of money you have already spent on transactions authorised, or pending or on any fees for the use of the Debit Card before it is cancelled or expires. You can cancel your Debit Card by creating a ticket in your online account, and confirming that you have destroyed your Debit Card and any additional Cards.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you cancel your Debit Card (and the associated ePayService account) once all transactions and fees have been deducted, we will arrange for any unused funds to be refunded to you, see Your Right to a Refund section below for further information. A Refund Fee may be charged in certain circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your Debit Card will be valid for three years. When it expires, unless we are told otherwise, we may issue you with a replacement Debit card.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Keeping your Debit Card secure<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          You should treat your Debit Card like cash. If it is lost or stolen, you may lose some or all of your money accessible via your Debit Card, in the same way as if you lost cash. You must keep your Debit Card safe and not let anyone else use it. If you are issued with a PIN, you should memorise the PIN, then destroy the notification and keep your PIN secret at all times. You can change your PIN at Chip enabled ATM by following the screen instructions or by logging into your online ePayService account.
        </li>
        <li>
          We recommend that you check the balance on your ePayService regularly online at the website. We will provide you with your balance and a statement of recent transactions on our secure webpage at any time. Your statement will show:
          <div style="padding-left:10px">
            i. information relating to each Debit Card transaction which will enable it to be identified;<br>
            ii. the amount of the Debit Card transaction shown in the currency in which the transaction was paid or debited to the account;<br>
            iii. the amount of charges for the transaction;<br>
            iv. the date the transaction is authorised or posted on to the account.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Lost and stolen Debit Cards and unauthorised or incorrectly executed payments<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          You must notify us by phone or email if your card has been lost or stolen; similarly you must notify if you know or suspect that the PIN or password is known to an unauthorised person or if you think a transaction has been incorrectly executed. If you believe a transaction on your card is fraudulent, you can report to us up to 13 months after the transaction is processed. The helpline number to report any issues related to your card is +44 (20) 81-3333-12.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provided you notify us promptly and you have not acted fraudulently or with gross negligence we will refund the amount of transaction which our investigations show are not authorised by you.
        </li>
        <li>
          However, if our investigations show that any disputed transaction was authorised by you, or you have acted fraudulently or with gross negligence (for example by failing to keep your Debit Card or PIN secure), you may be liable for any loss or misuse of the Card.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Our liability<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          We shall not be liable to you for any loss of profit or loss of revenue which in each case arises out of or in connection with: (i) this agreement or (ii) any breach or non-performance of this agreement, in each case no matter how fundamental (including by reason of Our negligence) or (iii) temporary or permanent inability to use your Debit Card for any reasons.
        </li>
        <li>
          We shall not be liable to you for:<br>
          <ol class="multi">
            <li>
              any loss of goodwill, reputation or opportunity; or
            </li>
            <li>
              any loss of or corruption of data; or
            </li>
            <li>
              any loss of anticipated savings in each of the foregoing whether direct or indirect; or
            </li>
            <li>
              any indirect or consequential loss, which in each case arises out of or in connection with this agreement or any breach or nonperformance of this agreement no matter how fundamental (including by reason of Our negligence).
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Our total liability arising under or in connection with this agreement or any breach or nonperformance of this agreement no matter how fundamental in contract, tort or otherwise shall be limited to the sums received by Us in aggregate under this agreement in the 12 months preceding the act or omission giving rise to the liability.
        </li>
        <li>
          We shall not guarantee 100% that your card will be accepted by every merchant. Your card acceptance will depend on each merchant’s own card acceptance rules and conditions. We will try to help cardholders with any card acceptance issues, however we will not be liable for any acceptance issues.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Refunding Transactions<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          You will be entitled to claim a refund in relation to transactions where:<br>
          <ol class="multi">
            <li>
              the transaction was not authorised under this agreement;
            </li>
            <li>
              we are responsible for a transaction which was incorrectly executed and you have notified us in accordance with section 8 above;
            </li>
            <li>
              a pre-authorised transaction did not specify the exact amount at the time of its authorisation and the amount charged by a supplier is more than you or an additional Debit Cardholder could reasonably have expected taking into account normal spending patterns on the Debit Card or the circumstances of the transaction;
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p style="padding-left:20px">
        We may change these terms at any time by notifying you by e-mail or other methods agreed, with at least 60 days before the change is due to take effect. We reserve the right to change these terms and conditions at shorter notice, provided there is no material change to them or to ensure we accommodate new regulatory requirements or ensure service continuity. The up-to-date version of the Debit Card terms and conditions will always be available on our website. The change will automatically take effect and you will be taken to have accepted the notified change unless you tell us that you do not agree to the change. In that event, we will treat that notice as notification that you wish immediately to terminate.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>Fees & Limits<br>
      <ol class="multi">
        <li>
          We do not charge any fees to you for checking your on-line balance and transactions on our website https://online.epayservices.com or other mobile applications offered by us. However other fees may apply. For all transactions made in a foreign currency we will charge a currency conversion fee of 1.99%. The rate used for conversion will be based on the Mastercard conversion rate applicable at the time the transaction is processed. Details of Mastercard conversion rates can be found at https://www.mastercard.com/global/currencyconversion/index.html. For more fee details please see the cardholder fee table under 12.5.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we decide to increase or introduce any new fees, we will tell you by e-mail, text, at least 60 days before any changes take effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          Authorisation will be requested for all transactions at the time of each transaction. In the unlikely event, for any reason whatsoever, a transaction is completed when there are insufficient funds for that transaction on the ePayService account associated with the Debit Card (a Shortfall), the Shortfall shall be reimbursed by you unless it is due to an error on the part of the retailer where the Debit Card was presented, in this circumstance we may seek the Shortfall from the retailer.
        </li>
        <li>
          You agree that once we make this Shortfall known to you, we may charge you for the Shortfall amount. We may charge the amount of the shortfall from any other account that you hold with us, to any other payment method which you may designate at that time, or against any funds which you may subsequently load onto your account. Until we are reimbursed the Shortfall amount, we may suspend your Debit Card and any additional Debit Cards or accounts connected to you. In addition, we reserve the right to charge you an Administration Fee for each transaction that you make using your Debit Card that results in a Shortfall or increases the Shortfall amount on your account.

      <li>Our services.</li>

      <p>Solid provides software services to you and Platforms to give you the ability to
      send and receive funds from third parties, in addition, to open up an Account.
      All funds transfer services are provided by Bank, as Solid does not receive,
      hold, or transmit funds. Our software allows you to send funds transfer
      instructions to Bank. Any funds balance displayed by Solid’s software are held
      in your Account, or otherwise held by Bank or Platform for your benefit, as
      applicable (“Account Balance”).</p>

      <p>Solid MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES RELATING TO
      YOUR FUNDS OR ACCOUNT BALANCES INCLUDING FEDERAL DEPOSIT
      INSURANCE CORPORATION (“FDIC”) INSURANCE COVERAGE. SUCH
      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MAY BE FOUND IN YOUR
      SPECIFIC ACCOUNT AGREEMENT OR AGREEMENT WITH YOUR
      PLATFORM. UNLESS NOTIFIED OTHERWISE BY SUCH AGREEMENTS,
      YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCES MAY LOSE VALUE IN THE EVENT BANK,
      THE BROKER-DEALER, OR PLATFORM ENTERS A RECEIVERSHIP.</p>

      <strong  class="heading-small">a. Bank account services.</strong>

      <p>We provide software services to facilitate your requests for services relating to
      your Account as detailed in such agreements. We are not responsible or liable
      if your request for such services is limited, delayed, or denied for risk,
      compliance, or other reasons.</p>

      <strong  class="heading-small">b. Transaction-only services.</strong>

      <p>As an agent of a Bank, we may provide you with services to process
      transactions to or from your Platform or a third party in addition to your
      Account. In certain circumstances relating to our transaction services, your
      funds may be held by Platform or Bank for your benefit and an account balance
      may be displayed to you by our software. To provide services under this
      section, we may collect personally identifiable information, your Bank Account
      login credentials or account and routing numbers for your Bank Account, or
      other User Data information as we may request from time to time as further
      detailed in these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy. Transactions
      processed via Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) will be processed in
      accordance with such timeframes except as otherwise noted in these Terms of
      Service. Such transaction services may be limited, delayed, or denied for risk
      and compliance reasons that we may not be able to disclose to you. You
      understand that the transactions may be limited, delayed, or denied and
      expressly disclaim any claims relating to such actions. We are not responsible
      for reviewing the accuracy of the transactions (amount, date, or the sender or
      receiver of funds). Additionally, we are not responsible if the receiver of funds
      rejects your transaction.</p>

      <strong  class="heading-small">c. Other services.</strong>

      <p>We may from time to time offer additional services or remove services without
      prior notice to you. You agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of such
      services as they may be offered to you.</p>

      <li>Fees.</li>

      <p>Fees for services offered under your Account are detailed in the specific
      Account agreements. If you use our Transaction services listed in Section 4(b),
      you may be charged a transaction fee by Platform or us as detailed in your
      agreement with Platform. Transactions completed on our website or mobile
      application may include a transaction fee as detailed when you make a
      transaction request.</p>

      <li>Reversals.</li>

      <p>In the event that a sender or the sender’s financial institution requests a
      reversal of payment or Solid decides against you in a dispute against you, we
      reserve the right to charge you a $15.00 fee in addition to the full amount of
      the transaction (collectively, the “Reversal Dues”). You agree to immediately
      reimburse for the Reversal Dues. Additionally, you authorize us to recover any
      Reversal Dues outstanding to Solid or Bank by debiting your available Account
      Balance. If you have an insufficient Account Balance, you authorize Solid and
      our Bank to take any of the following actions to recover the remaining amounts
      from you:</p>
      <p>a. Debit the Bank Account(s) linked to our services;</p>
      <p>b. Suspend your use of our services and require your immediate payment; or</p>

      <li>Protecting you and resolving disputes.</li>

      <p>Solid is always looking for ways to protect you from abusive business
      practices, security-related issues, and other issues you may encounter with
      Platform and our Banks. If you have a complaint against how Platform or Bank
      is providing services to you or using your User Data, just let us know by
      emailing us at <strong>legal@solidfi.com</strong> per below. We cannot warranty or guarantee
      anything under this section, but if we are able to help, we will work with you to
      resolve your complaint so long as such assistance is commercially reasonable
      and does not violate any agreements with third parties, regulations, or laws.
      Disputes relating to your Account shall be governed by your specific account
      agreements. Below is more information on how we can try to help you with
      other Disputes (as defined below).</p>

      <strong  class="heading-small">a. Dispute resolution.</strong>

      <p>You understand and agree that we are not responsible for the goods or
      services that you pay for using our services, including but not limited to those
      offered by your Platform and other third parties. Each Platform and seller that
      you purchase from is responsible for providing the goods and services that you
      purchase and for providing all customer service related to those goods and
      services. We recommend that you review Platform’s and, if applicable, a
      seller’s policies before completing your purchase. You are responsible for
      resolving any disputes that you may have with a
      Platform or a seller. If you have exhausted all options for resolving a complaint
      about abusive business practices, security-related issues, or other dispute with
      a Platform or a seller, you may choose to file a dispute claim with Solid
      (“Dispute”) by following the steps in this “Disputes” Section.</p>

      <p>By filing a Dispute, you understand and agree that:</p>

      <p>You are asking us to assist in resolving the dispute in its sole discretion and
      that such assistance or Solid’s decision may not be satisfactory to you;</p>

      <p>Solid’s assistance in resolving the dispute does not guarantee any particular
      outcome or any action on our part; and</p>

      <p>You release Solid and our officers, directors, agents, employees, subsidiaries,
      and suppliers from all claims, demands, and damages of any kind arising out of
      your dispute with a seller and Solid’s review of your Dispute.</p>

      <strong  class="heading-small">c. How to file a Dispute.</strong>To file a Dispute, follow these steps:<br>

      <strong  class="heading-small">i.

      <p>THE SERVICES UNDER THE TERMS OF SERVICE, Solid’S WEBSITE, AND
      ITS CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS
      WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ALL
      WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF
      TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES’
      RIGHTS, AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>

      <p>THE Solid SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE”,
      WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OF WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS,
      IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. USE OF THE Solid SERVICES IS AT YOUR
      OWN RISK. Solid, BANKS, AND OUR AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS,
      DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, AND SUPPLIERS, SPECIFICALLY
      DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
      FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NEITHER
      Solid NOR BANK HAVE CONTROL OF, OR LIABILITY FOR, ANY
      PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED BY PLATFORMS OR THAT ARE
      PAID FOR USING OUR SERVICES AND CANNOT ENSURE THAT ANY
      PLATFORM OR OTHER THIRD PARTY YOU TRANSACT WITH WILL

      INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU
      FROM Solid OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY
      WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN. NEITHER Solid NOR
      BANK SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS OR
      SYSTEM FAILURES THAT MAY AFFECT THE PROCESSING,
      COMPLETION, OR SETTLEMENT OF OUR SERVICE TRANSACTIONS.
      THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY SECTION SHALL APPLY TO THE
      FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE
      JURISDICTION</p>

      <p>Solid MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES RELATING TO
      YOUR FUNDS OR ACCOUNT BALANCES INCLUDING FEDERAL
      DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (“FDIC”) INSURANCE
      COVERAGE OR SECURITIES INVESTOR PROTECTION CORPORATION
      (“SPIC”) INSURANCE COVERAGE. SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND
      WARRANTIES MAY BE FOUND IN THE SPECIFIC ACCOUNT
      AGREEMENT OR AGREEMENT WITH YOUR PLATFORM. UNLESS
      NOTIFIED OTHERWISE BY SUCH AGREEMENTS, YOUR ACCOUNT
      BALANCES MAY LOSE VALUE IN THE EVENT BANK OR BROKER

      <strong class="heading-small">b. Force majeure.</strong>

      <p>You understand and agree we will not be held responsible for any losses or
      damages resulting from suspension of service due to extraordinary events or
      circumstances beyond our control. In such an event, Solid or Bank may
      suspend the services and access to your Account held by Bank or Platform for
      your benefit.</p>

      <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
      (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INCIDENTAL, AND CONSEQUENTIAL

      WEBSITES OR PHONE APPLICATIONS OR CONTENT THEREIN
      WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
      NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF WE HAVE
      BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME
      STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR
      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
      DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT
      APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH STATES, OUR LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO
      THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

      <strong class="heading-small">d. Indemnification.</strong>

      <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Solid and their respective
      officers, directors, employees, agents, and suppliers (collectively “Disclaiming
      Entities”) from and against any third party claim, suit, demand, loss, liability,
      damage, action, proceeding or suits and related liabilities, damages,
      settlements, penalties, fines, costs or expenses (including reasonable
      attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses) arising out of or relating to (i)
      your breach of any provision of these Terms of Service; (ii) your actions and
      omissions in connection with your accounts or our services; (iii) our actions
      and omissions, provided that they are taken/omitted in accordance with this
      Terms of Service or your instructions; or (iv) your violation of any laws and
      regulations; or (v) your negligent or reckless act or omission or willful
      misconduct of your employees, contractors, or agents. This provision shall
      survive the termination of these Terms of Service.</p>

      <strong class="heading-small">e. Binding Arbitration.</strong>

      <p>Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service,
      or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the
      American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration
      Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered
      in any court having jurisdiction thereof. In any arbitration arising out of or
      related to the Terms of Service, the arbitrators will award to the prevailing
      party, if any, the costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the
      prevailing party in connection with those aspects of its claims or defenses on
      which it prevails, and any opposing awards of costs and attorneys’ fees
      awards will be offset.<br>
      No class actions or similar process, and no joinder or consolidation of any
      claim with a claim of any other person or entity, shall be allowable in
      arbitration, without the written consent of both parties. The arbitrator shall have
      no authority to entertain any claim on behalf of a class, group, person, or entity
      who is not a named party to the arbitration, nor shall any arbitrator have
      authority to make any award for the benefit of, or against, any class, group,
      person, or entity who is not a named party to the arbitration. In the event that
      there is a dispute about whether limiting arbitration to non-class proceedings,
      or to the named parties, is enforceable under applicable law, then that
      question shall be resolved by a court rather than by an arbitrator, and to the
      extent, it is determined that resolution of a claim must proceed on a class
      basis, it shall so proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction rather than in
      arbitration.</p>

      <p>The place of arbitration shall be San Francisco, CA, except to the extent, the
      arbitration involves Bank and/or your Account, or a third-party service provider
      of Solid as a party to the dispute, then Solid may in its sole discretion move
      the place of arbitration to the location of such arbitration proceedings to which
      you have previously agreed to in such agreements (See, your specific Account
      Agreement Arbitration sections for more information of the place of
      arbitration).</p>

      <strong class="heading-small">
        ARBITRATION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM IS BINDING AND NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE THAT CLAIM THROUGH A COURT. IN ARBITRATION THE PARTIES WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS THAT APPLY IN COURT, SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JUDGE OR JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE OR BE REPRESENTED IN PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY OTHERS SUCH AS CLASS ACTIONS OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY AND THE RIGHT TO APPEAL MAY ALSO BE LIMITED OR ELIMINATED IN ARBITRATION. ALL OF THESE JUDICIAL RIGHTS ARE WAIVED WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE PARTIES ELECT TO ARBITRATE.
      </strong>

      <p>All claims, findings, and settlements under this “Binding Arbitration” shall be
        confidential information of Solid. You shall not disclose or reveal to
        employees, agents, Platform, or other third parties unless such information is
        already publicly available. Due to the unique nature of the confidential
        information, monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate us for
        your violation or threatened violation may cause irreparable injury to us and,
        in addition to any other remedies that may be available, in law, in equity or
        otherwise, we shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief against the threatened
        breach of confidentiality or the continuation of any such breach by you.</p>

      <li>Other legal terms.</li>

      <p>
        The Terms of Service are governed by the laws of the State of California. You
        agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state and federal
        courts in the State of California except as detailed in the “Binding Arbitration”
        Section. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be invalid by a
        competent court, the invalidity of such provisions shall not affect the validity of
        the remaining provisions. Likewise, if we choose to terminate any provision in
        accordance with the termination provision, that termination shall not affect the
        termination of other provisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we fail to act on or enforce, any provision in the Terms of Service, this shall
        not be construed as a waiver of that, or any other, provision. We will only grant
        waivers to specific provisions, for specific instances, in writing. The Terms of
        Service constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to
        this website and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements.
        The section headings are merely provided for convenience and shall not be
        given any legal import. You may not assign your rights and obligations under
        these Terms of Service. The Terms of Service will inure to the benefit of our
        successors, assignees, licensees, and sublicensees.

    <li>INTRODUCTION.</li>

    <p>This document, as amended or supplemented by the attached disclosures and pricing guides, (collectively, the “Account Terms”) contains
      the general terms, conditions and disclosures for the Evolve Bank & Trust transaction account (the “Account”) and constitutes an agreement
      between the Bank (as defined below) and you. For purpose of these Account Terms, the term “Account” may also collectively include SubDeposit Accounts.</p>

    <p>References to the “Bank,” “we,” “us,” or “our” means Evolve Bank & Trust and any of its affiliates. References to “you” and “your” means
      any person or entity that holds, owns or has authority to use, whether individually or on behalf of another person or entity, the Account. The
      Account Terms may be supplemented or amended as set forth in Section V(E) (Miscellaneous Terms). Bank services and access and use of
      your Account may be provided to you through the website and/or mobile phone application of our service provider (the “Service Provider,”
      and its website and mobile phone application, the “Service Provider Platform”). The Service Provider may offer you additional services
      through its Service Provider Platform, pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions between you and the Service Provider (the “Services”
      and such terms and conditions, the “Service Provider Terms”). Please see Section II (The Account) for additional information.</p>

    <p>By opening or continuing to maintain an Account with us, you agree to be bound by these Account Terms, and all applicable agreements,
      disclosures, and other documents, as well as by all applicable federal or state laws, statutes and regulations. Please keep a copy of these
      Account Terms.</p>

    <p>We may decline to open an Account for any reason, or for no reason. We are not liable for any damages or liabilities resulting from refusal
      of an Account relationship.</p>

    <p>THESE ACCOUNT TERMS IS SUBJECT TO MANDATORY ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND A WAIVER
      OF CLASS ACTION AND JURY PROVISION. PLEASE CAREFULLY READ SECTION IV (ARBITRATION AND WAIVERS).</p>

    <li>The Account.</li>

    <p><strong>A. Availability.</strong> The Account is available to an entity legally operating in the U.S. and with a U.S. physical address. The Account is only available for business purposes only, and you must not use it for personal, family or household purposes. You are not entitled to open an Account under these Account Terms if you are not a corporation, unincorporated business association, partnership, limited liability company, incorporated nonprofit organization or sole proprietorship. We reserve the right to close your Account if we determine that it is used for any impermissible purpose, as we may determine from time to time.</p>

    <p>You must also agree to go paperless. This means that: (1) you must keep us supplied with your valid email address and telephone number;
      and (2) you must agree to accept electronic delivery of all communications that we need or decide to send you. Please see the Evolve Bank &
      Trust Electronic Communication Consent for additional details. Note: Hyperlink this to the appropriate document.</p>

    <p><strong>B. Account Type and Ownership.</strong> The Account is a transaction account that pays a variable rate of interest and allows you to make certain payments and transfers to third
      parties. The Account is a business account that may be used only for business purposes. The Account may not be opened as a joint account.</p>

    <p>You cannot give a security interest or pledge your Account to someone other than us without first getting our express written consent. We
      are not required to give consent to a security interest or pledge to someone else. Unless we agree in a separate writing
      otherwise a security interest or pledge to someone else must be satisfied or released before any right to withdraw from the account can be
      exercised.</p>

    <p><strong>C. Opening an Account.</strong> To open an Account, you must submit to us an application and all information that we may require. You represent
      to the Bank that you are authorized to do business in the manner indicated to us and that the acts of person(s) opening the Account have
      been ratified. You agree that the Bank may rely on such representations without requiring additional information or documentation and that
      you will furnish such information upon request. You are solely responsible for meeting any legal requirements to establish and maintain the
      type of Account requested and have a duty to inform us of the status of any change to your organization, including any change to the type of
      entity. Federal regulations require that you provide us with information concerning the beneficial owners of a legal entity at Account opening.
      You may also be asked to provide such information at other times (and on any qualifying account) upon request of the Bank. You shall have a
      continuing obligation to provide any other documentation we may request from time to time, including any information required under our
      customer identification program to establish your identity. If at any time we determine that the beneficial ownership information you provided
      to us was false, incorrect, or of concern to the Bank, or if you refuse to provide us with the information when requested, we may close, block,
      restrict or freeze any or all of your Accounts.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right to require the Account holder(s) to furnish us with such resolutions, agreements or documents as we may
      reasonably request to evidence the authority of individuals to act on behalf of the Account holder(s). We will honor such an authorization
      until we receive written notice of change from the governing body of the organization. It is mutually agreed that the power and authority of
      each person named as authorized to take action with respect to the Account shall continue in full force and effect until we receive actual
      written notice of revocation, whether the same be brought about by dissolution of the Account holder or otherwise.</p>

    <p>By opening an Account, you agree that we can gather personal information about you and/or your beneficial owners from oneor more
      consumer reporting agencies, governmental entities and/or other third parties. You also agree that we have the right to access follow-up
      consumer reports while your Account is open for maintenance, review or collection purposes.</p>

    <p>Your Account will not be considered "opened" until it is funded. This means your balance must be at least a penny. Once your account is
      considered “opened,” there is no minimum balance required and no maximum balance limit. However, we may, at our sole discretion and at
      any time, require a minimum balance and set a maximum balance limit.</p>

    <p><strong>D. Service Providers.</strong> You understand that we have engaged Service Providers to perform a number of services for you under these
      Account Terms, including, but not limited to, identity verification, compliance monitoring, risk mitigation and management, managing your
      transfer instructions and other related services. Service Providers, along with their partners and agents, are the servicer of your Account. In
      that capacity, Service Provider may act on our behalf, perform our obligations or enforce our rights under these Account Terms. A Service
      Provider may also offer Services in connection with your Account to allow you to provide us with payment instructions and to view certain
      Account information using the Service Provider Platform. You understand that any payment instruction provided to us or activity performed in
      connection with your Account (including electronic fund transfers (“EFTs”)) using the Services shall be deemed authorized and valid and Bank
      is under no obligation to investigate the instruction or activity.</p>

    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we will not have any liability in connection with the Services and disclaim all warranties, either
      express or implied or statutory, including, but not limited to, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
      lack of viruses related to the Services. In no event shall we be liable for: (1) damages caused other than by our own gross negligence or
      intentional misconduct; or (2) indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to,
      damages for lost profits, disclosure of confidential information, or loss of privacy) arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability
      to use the Services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

    <li>Using Your Account and Account Disclosures.</li>

    <p><strong>A. Debit Card.</strong> In connection with your Account, we may (but are not obligated to) issue you a debit card (the “Card”) that will automatically
      link to the Account. If a Card is made available to you, it is subject to a debit card agreement by and between you and us.
      The Card may be used to initiate withdrawals at ATMs and points of sale and may be used to purchase goods and services. By using your Card,
      you authorize us and/or our agents to debit your Account. We reserve the right to refuse to make any transfer for security, credit, legal/
      regulatory, or other reasons, as we determine in our sole discretion. You are responsible for all transactions you authorize using the Card,
      including any losses, charges, or penalties incurred as a result. You may be charged for your use of the Card at ATMs. The Card is the property of
      the Bank, and if your Account is closed or your Card privileges are cancelled, you agree to stop using the Card and destroy it.</p>

    <p><strong>B. Linking Accounts.</strong> You may link your bank account at another financial institution (“Linked Account”) to your Account in order to transfer
      funds between your Linked Account and your Account. You represent and warrant: (1) that you have the right to authorize any and all charges
      and debits to the Linked Account; (2) the Linked Account is held at a depository institution located in the U.S.; (3) you are individually or jointly
      the owner of the Linked Account; and (4) the Linked Account is a business purpose or commercial account. You will indemnify and hold us
      harmless from any claims by any person related to the Linked Account, including any other owner of the Linked Account. You are not permitted
      to link your Account with a credit, debit, gift, or other type of card issued by a third party or another bank. You may deposit funds into or
      withdraw funds from your Account by using the Service Provider Platform to initiate an Automated Clearing House transfer (“ACH Transfer”) to
      or from the Linked Account. We do not accept requests made otherwise to initiate ACH Transfers. Requests for ACH Transfers to debit the
      Linked Account that are made before 4:00 PM MT on a business day, shall be considered received on the business day the request is made.
      Requests for ACH Transfers to debit the Linked Account that are made after 4:00 PM MT on a business day or on a non-business day, shall be
      considered received the next business day.</p>

    <p><strong>C. ACH Transfer Initiated by an External Bank or Through a Third Party.</strong> You may deposit funds into or withdraw funds from your Account
      by having an external bank (directly or through a third party) initiate an ACH Transfer to or from your Account at the Bank. The external
      account that you are depositing funds into or withdrawing funds from must be at an external bank located in the U.S.</p>

    <p><strong>D. Internal Transfer Between Accounts at the Bank.</strong> We may (but are not obligated to) permit you to initiate a transfer of funds between
      your accounts at the Bank through a Service Provider Platform. We do not accept requests made otherwise to initiate internal transfers.</p>

    <p><strong>E. Deposits.</strong> When you make a deposit, we will act only as your collection agent and will not be responsible beyond the exercise of good
      faith and ordinary care. All deposits are provisionally credited subject to our receipt of final payment. If a deposit or transfer of funds into your
      Account is returned or rejected by the paying financial institution for any reason, you agree that we may deduct the amount of the deposit or
      transfer against your Account, without prior written notice to you.</p>

    <ol class="agreement-list">
      <li>You may make a deposit into your Account by ACH Transfers or any other method we make available to you. You may also
        arrange for recurring deposits, such as direct deposits, to be made electronically to your Account.</li>
      <li>Foreign Currency and Cash Deposits. We do not accept any deposits denominated in any foreign currency. We do not accept
        any deposits in cash, whether in U.S. dollars or any foreign currency. All deposits are considered to be non-cash deposits.</li>
      <li>If we permit you to deposit a check into your Account, you agree not to deposit a check drawn on the same Account into which
        the check is being deposited. If available, you also agree not to deposit by ATM, mobile banking check deposit, or by mail any item
        that is drawn on a foreign bank or that is not denominated in US dollars. We may refuse a deposit, limit the amount of a deposit or
        return all or a portion of a deposit. We are not responsible for any deposit you mail to us that we do not receive. We will forward any
        items you deposit for collection to the bank on which the items are drawn. We may give you provisional credit for any item you
        deposit, which we may revoke at any time if we do not receive final payment for that item. All deposits to your Accounts, regardless of
        how made, are subject to verification, final payment, and our Deposit Availability Disclosure.</li>
      <li>You may only deposit with us funds that are immediately available, which under applicable law are irreversible and are not
        subject to any lien, claim or encumbrance.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>F. Withdrawals.</strong>
      <ol class="agreement-list">
        <li>Except as provided below, you may make withdrawals from your Account up to the available balance in your Account by any
          means that we make available to you. We may refuse a withdrawal request exceeding the available funds in your Account even if you
          make a deposit later in the business day after we refuse your withdrawal request. If your available balance is not enough to pay a
          transaction you make, we may assess an insufficient or unavailable funds fee, regardless of whether we pay the transaction. We may
          allow withdrawals at any time, but reserve the right to require seven (7) days written notice of intention to withdraw funds from your
          Account if your Account is a negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) account.</li>
        <li>You are not permitted to make withdrawals from your Account by creating a check drawn on your Account. If you attempt to
          make any transactions with your Account using a credit, debit, gift or other type of card issued by a third party or another bank or by
          creating a check drawn on your Account, we will reject and/or return the transaction without notice to you and may consider such
          action to be a violation by you of these Account Terms.</li>
        <li>Before allowing a transaction, we may request you to provide us with identification, authorization, documentation or other
          information that we deem necessary. We may refuse a withdrawal if you fail to comply with our request. We may tell you in advance
          when we are going to refuse a withdrawal request but will not be required to do so.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p><strong>G. Payment Instructions.</strong>
      <ol class="agreement-list">
        <li>
          <p>You agree that any payment instructions received by us (such as requests to withdraw or transfer funds from your Account) through
            the Service Provider Platform or in connection with your username, passphrase, PIN or mobile device used to access the Service
            Provider Platform (collectively “Credentials”) will be deemed to be authorized by you. The use of any of your
            Credentials by another person will be as effective as your use of the Credentials, regardless of whether the person affixing the
            Credential was authorized by you and regardless of the means by which the Credential was affixed. For example, if you provide your
            username and password used to access the Service Provider Platform to another person and that person uses that information to
            withdraw funds from your Account, we will deem the withdrawal to be authorized by you. Unless prohibited by applicable law, you
            agree to hold us harmless and indemnify us for any liability incurred for reasonably acting upon such instructions which bear any of
            your Credentials.</p>
          <p>You agree to keep confidential and to take all reasonable precautions and make all reasonable efforts to protect the
            secrecy of all Credentials issued to you, selected by you, or utilized by you. If any of your Credentials become lost or known to
            another person, you agree to notify us immediately so that a replacement may be issued. If you believe your Credentials are no
            longer secure or confidential, or that someone has used your Credentials without your permission, please contact us
            immediately by calling +1 (888) 610-2324 or notifying us through the Service Provider Platform.</p>
        </li>
        <li>We may refuse to follow any of your payment instructions if we think they are illegal or potentially harmful to us. If we follow
          your payment instructions, we may require other security measures to protect us from any losses we may suffer. To the greatest
          extent permitted by law. you agree to pay us back for any damages or losses (including, but not limited to, the reasonable costs of an
          attorney) that we suffer if we take an action based on your (or what appears to be your) oral, written or electronic instructions.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>



    <p><strong>H. Posting Order of Credits and Debits.</strong>
      <ol class="agreement-list">
        <li>
          <p><strong>Posting Orders.</strong> This section summarizes how we generally post some common transactions to your Account. Posting
            transactions to your Account impact your Account balance. Posting a credit increases your balance, while posting a debit or hold
            reduces your balance. Credits include deposits and credits we make. Holds include deposit holds, Card authorizations and holds
            related to withdrawals and EFTs. Debits include withdrawals, transfers, payments, Card transactions and fees.</p>

          <p>We use automated systems to process transactions and then to post transactions to your Account. When we process multiple
            transactions for your Account on the same day, you agree that we may in our discretion determine our posting orders for the
            transactions and that we may credit, authorize, accept, pay, decline or return credits, debits and holds in any order at our option.</p>

          <p>We generally post common transaction as follows. We group the different types of transactions into categories. We use several
            different categories for holds, credits, and debits. Most categories include more than one transaction type. After the end of the
            business day, our automated systems assign each transaction received for that day to a category. We generally post
            all transactions within a category, using the posting order or orders that apply to that category, before we post any
            transactions assigned to the next category.</p>

          <p>First, we start with the balance in your Account at the beginning of the business day, subtract holds from your balance, and make
            any adjustments from prior days. Next, we generally add available deposits and credits to your balance and then subtract debits from
            your balance based on the debit category. We subtract debits in a category from your balance in order from the highest to lowest
            dollar amount, unless specified otherwise herein. The first category of debits to be applied against your balance are certain Card and
            ATM transactions (e.g., Card transactions and ATM withdrawals and transfers). The debits within this category are subtracted from
            your balance in date and time order our systems receive date and time information. If we make checks available to you, this category
            is applied next against your balance. Check posting will be in sequential order based on the check number, and for any check for which
            the number cannot be read, from highest to lowest amount following the posting of number legible checks. We then subtract from
            your balance any other types of electronic debits in order from the highest to lowest dollar amount. These debits include ACH
            Transfers. Finally, we subtract from your balance most fees (such as monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, returned item fees, and
            ATM fees) in order from highest to lowest dollar amount. Some fees may show as “processing” until the next day.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Changing Posting Orders.</strong> You agree that we may determine in our discretion the orders in which we post transactions to your
          Account. You agree that we may determine in our discretion the categories, the transactions within a category, the order among
          categories and the posting orders within a category. We sometimes add or delete categories, change posting orders within categories
          and move transaction types among categories. You agree that we may in our discretion make these changes at any time without
          notice to you.</li>
        <li><strong>Posting Orders Determined at End of Day.</strong> We receive credits, debits and holds throughout the day. Regardless of when during
          the day we receive transactions for your Account, you agree that we may treat them as if we received all transactions at the same
          time at the end of the business day. During the day, we show some transactions as processing. Please note that transactions shown as
          processing have not been posted yet. The posting order for these transactions is determined at the end of the day, with the other
          transactions we receive for that day and based on the category. We do not always receive debits on the same day that you conduct
          them. We generally post credits and debits to your Account, and report them on your statement, in a different order than the order in
          which you conduct them or we receive them.</li>
        <li><strong>Overdraft Fees.</strong> We generally determine at the time we post a debit to your Account whether it creates an overdraft and
          whether an overdraft or returned item fee applies. You should note that sometimes we authorize a transaction at a time when you
          have enough available funds to cover it, but because other transactions post before it and reduce your balance, the transaction
          creates an overdraft when we post it to your Account. You can avoid fees for overdrafts and returned items by making sure that your
          Account always contains enough available funds to cover all of your transactions. When your Account balance includes some funds
          that are subject to a hold, dispute or legal process, you should note that those funds are not available to cover your transactions. Our
          posting orders can impact the number of overdraft fees we charge you when you do not have enough available funds to cover all of
          your transactions. When several debits arrive the same business day for payment from your Account and you do not have enough
          available funds in your Account to cover all of the debits we receive for that day, you understand that some posting orders can result
          in more overdrafts, and more fees for overdraft items and returned items, than if we had used other posting orders. You agree that we
          may in our discretion choose our posting orders, and also change them from time to time, regardless of whether additional fees may
          result. When your Account balance includes some funds that are not available at the time that we post a debit, and you do not have
          enough available funds in your Account to cover the debit, the debit results in an overdraft and we generally charge you an overdraft
          fee or returned item fee for the debit. We do not show holds or distinguish between available and unavailable funds in your Account
          balance on your statement.</li>

        <li><strong>Certain Transactions Made After Business Day Ends.</strong> During processing, we generally include in your Account balance some
          transactions that you make after the business day cut-off, but before the end of the calendar day. Deposits are made available based
          on Section VIII (Deposit Availability Disclosure). We generally subtract from your Account balance the following
          debits, when the transaction occurs after the cutoff time for the business day, but during the same calendar day: cash
          withdrawals made at an ATMs and any credit-push ACH Transfers of EFTs.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>



    <p><strong>I. Insurance Coverage.</strong> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insures deposits according to the ownership category in which
      the funds are insured. Not all accounts may be insured. Unless otherwise stated by us or the FDIC, the Account is insured by the FDIC up to the
      standard maximum deposit insurance amount per depositor, per ownership category (the “Standard Insurance Amount” or “SIA”). For purposes
      of determining the SIA applicable to your Account, you need to consider all accounts that you also hold at the Bank in the same ownership
      category. To determine SIA applicable to your Account with us and for any other FDIC insurance requirements that may apply, please visit the
      FDIC’s website at www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits or call the FDIC directly at 1-877- ASKFDIC (1-877-275-3342). You can also use the FDIC’s
      Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator (EDIE) at <a href="www.fdic.gov/edie">www.fdic.gov/edie</a>. Please see subsection L below for additional information regarding FDIC
      insurance coverage for Sub-Deposit Accounts.</p>

    <p><strong>J. Court Processes and Claims Against your Account.</strong> If we receive a levy, attachment, or other legal process against you or any party to
      your Account, we may refuse to permit withdrawals or transfers from your Account until the legal process is dismissed or satisfied. Any levy,
      attachment, or other legal process will be subject to our right of set-off and security interest. You are responsible for any losses, costs, or
      expenses we incur as a result of any dispute or legal proceeding involving your Account. If we receive a claim against the funds in your Account,
      or if we know of or believe that there‘s a dispute as to the ownership or control of funds in your Account, we may, in our discretion: (1) place a
      hold on your Account and refuse to pay out any funds until we‘re satisfied that the dispute is settled; (2) close your Account and send the
      balance to the named account holder(s); (3) require a court order to act; or (4) take any other action we feel is necessary to protect us. We will
      not be liable to you for taking any such action.</p>

    <p><strong>K. Statements.</strong> We will deliver or make available to you periodic statements for your Account at least four (4) times a year, unless your
      Account is determined to be inactive. The Account statement will describe payments or transfers made in connection with your Account. You
      agree to notify us promptly if you do not receive your statement by the date you normally would expect to receive it. Your periodic statement
      may be accompanied by items or a facsimile of those items listed on the statement, unless the item or an image of the item is unavailable for
      any reason. You agree that the statement and items all have been delivered or made available to you in a reasonable manner. We will not be
      responsible for any indirect, special or consequential damages under any circumstances for our inability to provide copies of an item. Our
      liability, if any, will not exceed the face amount of an item in question.</p>

    <p><strong>L. Sub-Deposit Accounts.</strong> We will, from time to time, place your funds provided to us in a deposit account or omnibus custody account (“SubDeposit Account”) with other depository institutions (each an “Insured Depository Institution”). You will not be charged a fee for our placement
      of your funds or in connection with the Sub-Deposit Account. We also will act as the agent/custodian with respect
      to your Sub-Deposit Account pursuant to this subsection. You consent to us placing funds with Insured Depository Institutions. If you do not
      consent to our placement of funds with Insured Depository Institutions, you should not open an Account or deposit funds with us.</p>

    <p>The Sub-Deposit Account will be established by an Insured Depository Institution that has entered into agreements with us. Your funds in the
      Sub-Deposit Account will bear the interest rates and APY you have agreed to with us (if any). All payments with respect to the Sub-Deposit
      Account by the Insured Depository Institutions will be made to us, and we will credit the funds to your Account.</p>

    <p>Your only rights with respect to the Sub-Deposit Account is to demand we repay you all amounts in your Account, including those
      transferred to the Sub-Deposit Account. The Sub-Deposit Account may not be transferred to another institution, except by us or the Insured
      Depository Institution. You may terminate our role as your agent/custodian and our ability to deposit funds you provide us in the SubDeposit Account. Any termination will result in a return of funds in accordance with law and closing of your Account and any Sub-Deposit
      Account opened specifically for you.</p>

    <p>When we place funds with Insured Depository Institution and act as your agent with respect to the Sub-Deposit Account, we will ensure the
      records of the Insured Depository Institution are in our name, as agent or custodian. The funds deposited in the Sub-Deposit Account will be
      FDIC insured to the same extent as if such funds were held in the Account with us. In other words, the depositing of your funds into the SubDeposit Account will not otherwise increase your FDIC deposit insurance coverage. You will not receive any written confirmation of the
      establishment of the Sub-Deposit Account or transfer of funds to the Sub-Deposit Account; instead, we will maintain
      records clearly indicating the transfer and beneficial ownership of the Sub-Deposit Account. You must immediately report to us any changes
      in Account ownership information that you originally provided to us in connection with the submission of your application for an Account.</p>

    <p>Our placing of funds may reflect considerations of federal and state law, our funding needs and funding needs of Insured Depository
      Institutions, general economic conditions or other factors determined by us in our sole discretion. We will not place funds with more than
      one Insured Depository Institution. We may place funds to enhance our business objectives and for balance sheet management without any
      benefit to you, including increased FDIC deposit insurance coverage. Further, we may receive greater benefits when we
      place your funds with an Insured Depository Institution than if we otherwise maintained your funds with us. We are under no obligation to
      place your funds with an Insured Depository Institution.</p>

    <p>A Sub-Deposit Account will be a deposit obligation of the Insured Depository Institution that maintains the Sub-Deposit Account;
      provided, this does not modify our obligation to repay all amounts you deposited in your Account.</p>

    <p>All deposits that are maintained with an Insured Depository Institution in the Sub-Deposit Account are aggregated with deposits maintained
      in your Account with us for purposes of the SIA. Funds you hold in one or more Accounts with us (including funds we maintain before
      placement with Insured Depository Institution), funds in the Sub-Deposit Account and any funds resulting from payment of interests on an
      Sub- Deposit Account will be aggregated for FDIC insurance purposes with all other deposits you hold in deposit accounts with us in the same
      ownership category and therefore may not be fully insured by the FDIC. For the avoidance of doubt, funds deposited in the Sub-Deposit
      Account will be treated as funds on deposit in the Account with us for FDIC insurance calculation purposes. As such, your total FDIC deposit
      insurance coverage for funds you provide us for deposit in your Account will not be increased by nature of any deposit of funds in the SubDeposit Account. Please see subjection J above for additional information on determining SIA.</p>

    <p>We may provide your name, tax identification number and other pertinent identifying information to Insured Depository Institution, and
      other parties providing services in connection with the placement of your funds and the establishing and holding the Sub-Deposit Account.
      You hereby consent to such release of information. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent us from disclosing information to a
      third party if required by law.</p>

    <p>We will act as your agent in connection with the placement of your funds with the Insured Depository Institution and the establishment and
      maintenance of the Sub-Deposit Account. Although we will act as your limited agent in connection with the placement of your funds, we are
      not acting as your financial adviser. See subsection A of Section V for additional information. You hereby appoint us to act as your agent for
      purposes of placing funds with Insured Depository Institutions and establishing and maintaining, on your behalf, the Sub-Deposit Account. You
      further authorize us to collect for you all interest and other payments related to an Sub- Deposit Account, to place funds with Insured
      Depository Institution pursuant to the terms set forth herein, and to execute and deliver or file on your behalf all appropriate receipts,
      agreements, releases and other instruments, including whatever agreements may be required from Insured Depository Institution, for the
      purpose of establishing your ownership interest in the Sub-Deposit Account and maintaining an Sub Deposit Account.</p>

    <p>Although there are two or more accounts associated with your funds (the account maintained with us, referred to as the Account, and the
      Sub-Deposit Account), your Account is considered a single account for your deposits and withdrawals, as well as for tax reporting, balance
      requirement, service charge, monthly statement and FDIC deposit insurance purposes. The existence of the Sub-Deposit Account and any
      other account maintained by us pursuant to these Account Terms is for internal purposes and will not change the manner in which you use,
      obtain information about or earn interest (if any) on your Account. These transfers, including the placement transfer, will not appear on your
      monthly statement.</p>

    <p><strong>M. Interest and Interest Rate.</strong> If your Account is an interest bearing account, the following provisions apply. A minimum deposit of $1.00 is
      required to earn the Annual Percentage Yield (“APY”) disclosed to you from time to time. We only pay interest in whole cents and use standard
      rounding rules to calculate the amount of interest earned. This means that an amount equal to or greater than one half of one cent accrued
      during a monthly interest period is rounded up to the next whole cent and an amount less than one half of one
      cent accrued during a monthly interest period is rounded down to zero. Interest is compounded daily and credited to your Account monthly.
      Interest is calculated using the daily balance method. This method applies a daily periodic rate to the principal and interest that has accrued in
      the Account each day. This means that the interest from your Account is calculated every day on a 365-day year (and 366-day for leap year).
      Interest begins to accrue on the business day that we receive your deposit. If the Account is closed before interest is credited, accrued interest
      will be paid through the last full day before the day the Account is closed. The rate at which interest may be paid on the principal balance of the
      Account, and the corresponding APY at which the Account would earn interest each year if all interest paid on the Account remains in the
      Account, can be found on the Service Provider Platform, which may be modified by from time to time in our sole discretion. We may, at our
      discretion, at any time, change the interest rate and the APY.</p>

    <p><strong>N. Prohibitions.</strong> You must not use your Card or Account for any illegal purpose or internet gambling. This prohibition includes any
      transaction that is illegal in the jurisdiction where you live, in the jurisdiction where the transaction is consummated, or in any other jurisdiction
      affected by the transaction. You are responsible for determining the legality of each of your transactions in all applicable jurisdictions before
      entering into the transaction. We have no obligation to monitor, review or evaluate the legality of any transaction. Nevertheless, we may deny
      transactions or authorizations if we believe the transaction is or may be illegal. We reserve the right to refuse or return any item that we
      believe is related to an illegal transaction, an Internet or online gambling transaction or a high-risk transaction. To the fullest extent permitted
      by law, you agree to pay for any item or transfer that you authorized, even if the transaction related to that item or transfer is determined to be
      illegal.</p>

    <p><strong>O. Fees.</strong> You agree to pay all fees and charges applicable to your Accounts, which will be automatically deducted from your Accounts
      and may result in your Accounts being overdrawn. The amounts of these fees and charges, the manner in which they are calculated, and the
      ways to potentially avoid them are listed in our Fee Schedule. Fees and our Fee Schedule are subject to change at any time and without
      notice to you, unless required by law. Fees set forth in the Fee Schedule are charged by Bank for its services. Service Provider may charge
      you fees separate and apart from the fees set forth in the Fee Schedule for its Services, pursuant to the Service Provider Terms. Bank is not
      responsible for any fees charged by Service Provider for its Services.</p>

    <p><strong>P. Power of Attorney/Agents.</strong>
      References to you also include any person who you authorize to act on your behalf, whether by following
      the process we require (for example, by designating an authorized signer on a signature card), or on your own (for example, by creating a
      power of attorney). If you name such an agent:
      <ol class="agreement-list">
        <li>We may require that you use forms we approve and require each owner to sign the form to be effective;</li>
        <li>The powers you give to your agent, and any limitations on those powers, are between you and your agent, even if we have
          express written notice of those powers. You understand and agree that we have no duty or responsibility to monitor the acts of your
          agent or ensure that the acts of your agent are for your benefit. For example, if you only give your agent authority to pay your bills
          and your agent exceeds that authority, we are not responsible for that breach of authority;</li>
        <li>You agree not to hold us responsible for any loss or damage you incur as a result of us following instructions given to us by
          your agent;</li>
        <li>The owner of the Account is responsible to us for any actions of your agent, regardless of whether those actions exceed
          the authority given or whether the agent is formally nominated by all the owners or less than all the owners;</li>
        <li>The agency will end after the owner notifies us in writing to end the agency and we have had a reasonable opportunity to act
          on it; and</li>
        <li>If you authorize any third person, such as a bookkeeping service, an employee, or agent of yours to retain possession of or
          prepare items or any transactions using your Account, you agree to assume full responsibility for any errors or wrongdoing
          performed or caused by such third person or any of its agents or employees if we should pay any such item.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Q. Bankruptcy Cost.</strong> If your Account becomes subject to a receivership, court order or bankruptcy, and we are required to implement
      changes as to your Account that increase our costs to maintain your Account (for example, a requirement for us to pledge
      property to secure your Account above the amount of any deposit insurance on your Account), you agree to reimburse us for the
      additional costs and any expenses incurred by us (including legal fees) to implement such required changes as to your Account.</p>

    <p><strong>R. Monitoring and Closing Your Account.</strong> Subject to the terms herein, you can close your Account at any time and for any reason by
      contacting us or terminating the Account through the Service Provider Platform, if applicable. We reserve the right to refuse your request to
      close your Account if your Account is not in good standing or if you have a negative balance on your Account. If you intend to close your
      Account, you should notify us. Simply reducing your Account balance to $0.00 is insufficient notice. If you close your Account you are
      responsible for transactions you initiated or authorized, including those that we receive after the Account is closed. Withdrawals from your
      Account may be restricted prior to Account closing.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right (but are not obligated) to monitor all Account activity for inappropriate use. We can close your Account at any time,
      for any reason, without advance notice. If we close your Account, we will notify you by mail, electronically or by telephone that we have closed
      your Account unless your Account has had a zero balance for thirty (30) days or more. If we close your Account, all collected funds (less any
      amounts due to us or for debits in process) will be transferred to your Linked Account. Alternatively, we may, at our
      discretion, mail you a check for the available balance in your Account. Written notice that the Account has been closed and a check, if any,
      will be sent to any address shown on our records for you, or if the Account is a jointly owned, to any account owner to whom we elect to
      send it. Once we have closed your Account, you agree that we can assess any service charge otherwise applicable against any remaining
      balance in your Account. We are not responsible to you for any damages you may suffer as a result of your Account being
      closed. If you attempt to make a deposit to an Account we closed, we may collect the deposit and set-off your indebtedness to us. Any funds
      in excess of $1.00 will be returned to you.
      State laws (called "escheat" or unclaimed property laws) require us to close your Account and transfer your money to the state if your
      Account is dormant for a period of time as defined by your state of residence. Your Account can become dormant if, for 24 months, there is
      no transactional activity. If your Account becomes dormant, you may no longer receive statements, but you can still view your accounts
      online.</p>

    <p>State abandoned property law establishes guidelines under which unclaimed property must be surrendered to the applicable state.
      Generally, the funds in your Account are considered unclaimed if you have not had any activity or communication with us regarding your
      Account over a period of years, defined by your state of residence. All products offered by us are subject to abandoned property laws. If your
      funds are surrendered to the state, you may be able to reclaim them, but your claim may need to be presented to the state. You can avoid the
      transfer of your money to the state simply by signing into your Account, transacting periodically, or contacting us, or replying to any abandoned
      property correspondence.</p>

    <p><strong>S. Fraud and Unauthorized Transactions.</strong>
      <ol class="agreement-list">
        <li>
          <p><strong>Duty to Safeguard Account.</strong> You agree to keep any Account information, Credentials, security code, password or other
            confidential identification number used to access your Account secure and strictly confidential and to not permit disclosure of such
            information to any unauthorized person. You agree to immediately notify Bank if this information has become known to, or been
            used by, an unauthorized person. You acknowledge that Bank has no method to determine whether a transaction conducted with use
            of a valid Account name, Account number, Credentials and/or security code was proper, and you therefore authorize Bank to
            complete any transaction involving your Account made with the use of such information.</p>
          <p>You agree to be responsible for any transaction initiated with the use of a valid Credentials or any access device. Bank shall have
            no liability for any loss, claim, or damage sustained as a result of the use of your Credentials or access device whether such
            transaction was authorized or not and agree to indemnify and hold harmless Bank for any such transaction alleged to be
            unauthorized.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Duty to Review Account Statement.</strong> You agree to review your Account statement within thirty (30) days from the statement date.
          Because you are in the best position to discover an unauthorized transaction, you agree that, without regard to care or lack of care
          by either you or Bank, we will not be liable for any transaction, subject to applicable law and payment
          network rules. If you choose not to receive your statements, you remain responsible to review and report any errors. If you are
          absent from your Account mailing address, you are responsible to make arrangements to have your statements reviewed for errors
          and report them in a timely manner.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Duty of Care.</strong> You agree that you will exercise ordinary care in handling your Account. In exercising ordinary care, you shall have
          the duty to: carefully examine your bank statements for fraudulent or unauthorized transactions and promptly notify Bank of any such
          transaction; timely reconcile your statement with your internal records to detect any other Account discrepancies, including any
          missing or diverted deposits; implement security precautions regarding the use and access of your Accounts through any access
          device, Credentials, security codes, passwords, or confidential identification numbers; conduct background checks of all individuals
          having access to any Credentials, security or access devices or sensitive Account information; conduct background checks on all
          individuals who have authority to prepare Account transactions or reconcile statements; independently review the work of individuals
          who are responsible for reconciling statements and preparing transactions using your Account; and comply with all other duties under
          this Agreement or under any applicable law. Your failure to exercise ordinary care will constitute negligence and will preclude you from
          asserting against Bank any unauthorized transaction on your Account.</li>

        <li><strong>Fraud Detection Tools.</strong> [Service Provider to insert any it may offer for UCC 4A purposes.]</li>

        <li><strong>Limitation to File Claim.</strong> You agree that no legal proceeding or action may be commenced against Bank to recover any amounts
          alleged to have been improperly paid out of the Account due to any fraudulent or unauthorized transaction unless: (i) you have timely
          provided written notice as required by subsections 1 and 2 of this paragraph S (Fraud and Unauthorized Transactions), and (ii) such
          proceeding or action shall have been commenced within six (6) months from the date the first statement containing the unauthorized
          transaction was made available to you. Any proceeding or action not brought within one year from the date of the first statement
          containing the unauthorized transaction is forever barred.</li>

        <li><strong>Duty to Cooperate.</strong> If you report any unauthorized transaction on your Account, you agree to cooperate with Bank in its
          investigation of the claim. This includes preparing an affidavit and report containing whatever information Bank requires concerning
          the Account, the transaction and the circumstances surrounding the loss. You also agree to file a criminal report against any
          suspected wrongdoer and waive any claims against Bank if you fail to do so or if you enter into any settlement, compromise or
          restitution agreement with the wrongdoer without the consent of the Bank. Bank may reverse any credit or reimbursement should
          you fail to file the criminal report or refuse to testify against the wrongdoer.</li>

        <li><strong>Duty of Insurance.</strong> You are under a duty to maintain fidelity bond coverage on any individual who has access to your Account
          information, Credentials or access devices and on any individual responsible for reviewing or reconciling statements. You agree to
          pursue all rights under such policy or any other insurance policy you maintain before making a claim against Bank in connection with
          any unauthorized banking transaction. You agree to provide Bank with all reasonable information about your insurance coverage,
          including the name of the insurance carrier, the policy number, policy limits, and applicable deductibles. Bank’s liability, if any, will be
          reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds you are entitled to receive. At Bank’s request, you agree to assign your rights
          under any insurance policy to Bank.</li>

        <li><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> You agree that Bank has a reasonable time to investigate the facts and circumstances surrounding any
          claimed loss and that we have no obligation to provisionally credit your Account. Bank’s maximum liability is the lesser of actual
          damages proved or the amount of the unauthorized withdrawals, reduced by an amount which could have been avoided had you
          exercised ordinary care. In no event will Bank be liable for special or consequential damages, including loss of profits and opportunity
          or for attorneys’ fees. Bank will not be liable for any items that are forged or altered in such a way that such forgery could not be
          reasonably detected.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <li>Arbitration and Waivers.</li>

    <p>THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW LEGAL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US ARE RESOLVED.
      PLEASE READ THIS SECTION IV (ARBITRATION AND WAIVERS) CAREFULLY. For a dispute subject to arbitration, neither you nor we will have the
      right to: (A) have a court or a jury decide the dispute; (B) engage in information-gathering (discovery) to the same extent as in court; (C)
      participate in a class action in court or in class arbitration; or (D) join or consolidate a claim with claims of any other persons. Arbitration
      procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. The decision of the arbitrator is final and binding.</p>

    <p><strong>A. Definitions.</strong> If you have a dispute with us or our Service Provider, and we are not able to resolve the dispute informally, you and we
      agree that upon demand by either you or us, the dispute will be resolved through the arbitration process as set forth in this section. A “claim”
      or “dispute,” as used in this Section IV (Arbitration and Waivers), is any unresolved disagreement between you, us and/or our Service Provider,
      arising from or relating in any way to the Account or these Account Terms. The terms “claim” and “dispute” are to be given the broadest
      possible meaning that will be enforced and includes, by way of example and without limitation, any disagreement relating in any way to
      services offered in connection with an Account or any other services offered pursuant to these Account Terms; to your use of any of our
      banking products or services; to any means you may use to access your Account(s); to any advertisements, promotions or oral or written
      statements related to the Account; to the benefits and services related to an Account; or your approval, establishment or enrollment for an
      Account. Claims also include disagreements about the meaning, application or enforceability of this arbitration agreement. As solely used in
      this Section IV (Arbitration and Waivers), “we” or “us” shall include the Bank, its affiliates and service providers and their successors,
      employees, directors, officers and agents, and the terms “you” or “yours” shall mean each Account owner and all persons or entities approved
      to have, approved to use and/or given access to an Account. The term “Account,” for purposes of arbitration, includes any updated or
      substitute Account for you.</p>

    <p><strong>B. Binding Arbitration and Appeals.</strong> Arbitration applies whenever there is a claim between you and us. If a third party is also involved in a
      claim between you and us, then the claim will be decided with respect to the third party in arbitration as well, and it must be named as a party
      in accordance with the rules of procedure governing the arbitration. No award or relief will be granted by the arbitrator except on behalf of, or
      against, a named party. Claims are subject to arbitration, regardless of on what theory they are based, whether they seek legal or equitable
      remedies, or whether they are common law or statutory (Federal or state) claims. Arbitration applies to any and all such claims or disputes,
      whether they arose in the past, may currently exist, or may arise in the future.</p>

    <p>Judgment upon the arbitrator’s award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding, except
      for any right of appeal provided by the FAA. However, if the amount of the claim exceeds $25,000 or involves a request for injunctive or
      declaratory relief that could foreseeably involve a cost or benefit to either party exceeding $25,000, any party can, within thirty (30) days after
      the entry of the award by the arbitrator, appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the forum. The panel shall reconsider
      anew all factual and legal issues, following the same rules of procedure and decide by majority vote. Reference in this Section IV (Arbitration
      and Waivers) to “the arbitrator” shall mean the panel if an appeal of the arbitrator’s decision has been taken.</p>

    <p><strong>C. Initiation of Arbitration.</strong> Any claim must be resolved, upon the election by you or us, by arbitration pursuant to this Section IV
      (Arbitration and Waivers) and the code of procedures of the national arbitration organization to which the claim is referred in effect at the
      time the claim is filed. Claims shall be referred to either Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) or the American Arbitration
      Association (“AAA”), as selected by the party electing to use arbitration. If a selection by us of one of these organizations is unacceptable to
      you, you have the right within ten (10) days after you receive notice of our election to select the other organization listed to serve as
      arbitrator administrator. For a copy of the procedures, to file a claim or for other information about these organizations, contact them as
      follows: (i) JAMS at 1920 Main Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 92614; website at www.jamsadr.com; and (ii) AAA at 335 Madison Avenue,
      New York, NY 10017; website at <a href="www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>.</p>

    <p>In the event that JAMS or the AAA is unable to handle the dispute for any reason, then the matter shall be arbitrated instead by a neutral
      arbitrator selected by agreement of the parties pursuant to the AAA rules of procedure; or, if the parties cannot agree, selected by a court in
      accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code) (“FAA”). To the extent that there is any variance between the
      selected forum’s rules and this Section IV (Arbitration and Waivers), this Section IV (Arbitration and Waivers) shall control.</p>

    <p>If you initiate the arbitration, you must notify us in writing at: 2955 Campus Drive #110, San Mateo, CA 94403. If we initiate the
      arbitration, we will notify you in writing at your last known address in our file.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>D. Class Action and Jury Waiver.</strong> NEITHER YOU NOR WE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE DISPUTES BY OR AGAINST OTHERS IN
      ANY COURT ACTION OR ARBITRATION, OR TO INCLUDE IN ANY COURT ACTION OR ARBITRATION ANY DISPUTE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR
      MEMBER OF A CLASS, OR TO ACT IN ANY ARBITRATION IN THE INTEREST OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
      CAPACITY, UNLESS THOSE PERSONS ARE BENEFICIARIES ON YOUR ACCOUNT. THIS IS SO WHETHER OR NOT THE CLAIM HAS BEEN ASSIGNED.
      FURTHER, NEITHER YOU NOR WE SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A CLAIM IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON A CLAIM, OR TO ENGAGE
      IN DISCOVERY, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE CODE OF PROCEDURES OF JAMS OR AAA.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>E. Location of Arbitration and Cost.</strong> The arbitration shall take place in the Federal judicial district located in Memphis, Tennessee, unless the
      parties agree to a different location in writing. The party initiating the arbitration (or appeal of the first arbitration award) shall pay the initial
      filing fee. All fees and costs will be allocated in accordance with the rules of the arbitration forum. Each party shall bear the expense of their
      respective attorneys, experts, and witnesses and other expenses, regardless of who prevails, but the arbitrator will have the authority to award
      attorneys and expert witness fees and costs to the extent permitted by these Account Terms, the forum’s rules, or applicable law.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>F. Governing Law.</strong> You and we agree that in our relationship arising from these Account Terms: (1) the parties are participating in
      transactions involving interstate commerce; (2) the arbitrator shall decide any dispute regarding the enforceability of this arbitration
      agreement; and (3) this arbitration agreement and any resulting arbitration are governed by the provisions of the FAA, and, to the extent any
      provision of that act is inapplicable, the laws of the State of Tennessee. The arbitrator must apply applicable substantive law consistent with
      the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations and claims of privilege recognized at law. At the timely request of either party, the arbitrator
      must provide a brief written explanation of the basis for the award.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>G. Continuation and Severability.</strong> This Section IV (Arbitration and Waivers) shall survive termination of your Account, these Account Terms
      and any bankruptcy by you or us. If any portion of this Section IV (Arbitration and Waivers) is deemed invalid or unenforceable under any
      principle or provision of law or equity, consistent with the FAA, it shall not invalidate the remaining portions of this Section IV (Arbitration and
      Waivers), these Account Terms or any prior agreement you may have had with us, each of which shall be enforceable regardless of such
      invalidity.
    </p>

    <li>Miscellaneous Terms.</li>

    <p>
      <strong>A. Ordinary Card; No Fiduciary Obligation.</strong> You agree that any act or omission made by us in reliance upon or in accordance with any
      provision of the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the State of Tennessee, or any rule or regulation of the State of Tennessee or a federal
      agency having jurisdiction over the Bank, shall constitute ordinary care. We do not assume any fiduciary obligation on your behalf. This means
      that we do not act as your trustee or financial advisor, and we don't assume any responsibility for your account beyond reasonable care.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>B. Account Disputes.</strong> If a dispute arises concerning your Account (including, for example, a dispute over who is an authorized signer or
      owner), or if we believe we have a claim against you or we have or receive a claim by a third party (including our affiliates) to all or a portion of
      the property (including money, certificates of deposit, securities and other investment property, financial assets, etc.) in your Account, or if we
      have concerns regarding your Account or the use of your Account, we have the right to hold any portion of the property in your Account until
      the dispute, claim, or concern is resolved to our satisfaction. We will not be liable to you if the hold we place on your Account leaves
      insufficient funds to cover outstanding transactions. If the dispute, claim or concern remains unresolved, you agree that we may at our option
      deposit the property in your Account with a court and ask the court to determine to whom the property belongs. If we deposit your property
      with a court, you agree that we may charge your Account for our costs, including attorney’s fees and expenses
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>C. Governing Law, Forum and Time Limits.</strong>
      <ol class="agreement-list">
        <li>All Accounts are opened at the Tennessee branch office of the Bank. All actions relating to your Account, including these
          Account Terms, will be governed by the laws and regulations of the United States and the State of Tennessee (to the extent that laws
          of the State of Tennessee are not preempted by Federal law). Federal and the laws of the State of Tennessee shall be applied without
          giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.</li>
        <li>To the extent any dispute arising under these Account Terms or relating in any way to your Account or your relationship
          with us is not arbitrated, you consent to the jurisdiction of, and agree that such dispute will be resolved by the Federal or state
          court located in Shelby County, Tennessee.</li>
        <li>You must file any lawsuit or arbitration against us within two (2) years after the claim arises, unless Federal law or the laws of
          the State of Tennessee or an applicable agreement provides for a shorter time. This limit is in addition to limits on notice as a
          condition to making a claim. If Tennessee law does not permit contractual shortening of the time during which a lawsuit must be filed
          to a period as short as two (2) years, you agree to the shortest permitted time under Tennessee law. Any action against us must be
          brought within the period that the applicable law requires us to preserve records, unless applicable law or this agreement provides a
          shorter limitation period.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>D. Reporting Information.</strong> We may report information about your Account to consumer reporting agencies, governmental
      agencies, and/or third-party data services. Defaults on your Account may be reflected in your business credit report.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>E. Compliance with Law.</strong> You agree to comply with applicable law and to not use your Account for illegal transactions or
      activities.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>F. Changes in Terms.</strong> We may change these Account Terms, or any fees and features of your Account, at any time. We will give you
      advance notice of any change required by law in accordance with such law. We may provide this notice to you on or with your statement, by
      mailing the notice to you directly or by posting the notice on the Service Provider Platform. We may change or terminate these Account Terms
      without notice to comply with any appropriate Federal or state law or regulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>G. Security Interest.</strong> You grant us a security interest in your Account to secure payment of any money that you owe to us arising under
      these Account Terms or any other agreements with us. You acknowledge and grant us the right to use any of the funds in your Account to
      cover any money you owe to us (a “right of set-off”). You agree that the security interests you have granted to us are consensual and in
      addition to any rights of set-off. We may exercise our security interest or right of set-off without prior recourse to other sources of repayment
      or collateral, if any, and even if such action causes you to lose interest, incur any penalty or suffer any other consequence. If we exercise our
      security interest or right to set-off, we will notify you to the extent required by applicable law. If the law imposes conditions or limits on our
      ability to take or set off funds in your Account, to the extent that you may do so by contract, you waive those conditions and limits, and you
      authorize us to apply funds as we deem applicable. We will consider these Account Terms as your consent for us asserting our security interest
      or exercising our right of set-off should any laws governing your Account require your consent.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>H. No Waiver of Rights.</strong> If we fail to exercise or waive a right with respect to your Account on one or more occasions, it does not mean we
      have waived, or are obligated to waive, the same right on any other occasion. We may release any other person obligated under these Account
      Terms without affecting your responsibilities under these Account Terms. In any event, no such waiver or delay by us is effective unless it is in
      writing and approved by us.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>I. Assignment.</strong> Your Account is not transferable and is not assignable as collateral for a loan or for any other purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>J. Other Services and Conflicts.</strong> If we make available to you any of our other banking services offered in connection with your Account
      (e.g., check services), we may provide certain terms and conditions of the additional service to you in a separate agreement or disclosure. If a
      service we offer has a separate agreement, and there is a conflict between the terms of these Account Terms and the separate agreement, the
      separate agreement shall control.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>K. Privacy Policy.</strong> You authorize us to share information about you and your Account with our affiliates and third parties, unless
      applicable law or our <a href="https://www.getevolved.com/privacy-policy/">Privacy Notice</a> prohibits us from doing so. Please see our Privacy Notice for your choices about information sharing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>L. Severability.</strong> In the event that any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of these Account Terms is
      illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remainder of these Account Terms shall not be affected thereby. To the extent permitted by applicable
      law, the parties hereto waive any provision of law which prohibits or renders unenforceable any provision hereof, and to the extent that such
      waiver is not permitted by applicable law, the parties intend that such provision be interpreted as modified to the minimum extent necessary
      to render such provision enforceable.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>M. Limitation of Liability, Disclaimer of Warranty, Indemnification and Reimbursements.</strong>
      <ol class="agreement-list">
        <li>Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS, COSTS,
          LOSSES, OR DAMAGES RESULTING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM OUR FAILURE TO ACT, OR ANY DELAY BEYOND TIME LIMITS
          PRESCRIBED BY LAW OR PERMITTED BY THESE ACCOUNT TERMS IF SUCH FAILURE OR DELAY IS CAUSED BY YOUR NEGLIGENCE, ACTS
          OR OMISSIONS OF THIRD PARTIES, INTERRUPTION OR MALFUNCTION OF EQUIPMENT OR COMMUNICATION FACILITIES, SUSPENSION
          OF PAYMENTS BY ANOTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, FIRE, NATURAL DISASTERS, ELEMENTS OF NATURE, GOVERNMENT ACTION, ACTS
          OF WAR, TERRORISM OR CIVIL STRIFE, EMERGENCY CONDITIONS, OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND THE REASONABLE CONTROL
          OF THE BANK, PROVIDED THE BANK EXERCISED SUCH DILIGENCE AS THE CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE
          REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE BANK SHALL BE EXCUSED FROM SUCH FAILURE TO ACT OR DELAY AS LONG AS SUCH
          CIRCUMSTANCES PREVAIL, AND THE BANK CONTINUES TO USE ITS COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO RECOMMENCE
          PERFORMANCE. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, OUR LIABILITY TO YOU FOR A CLAIM IS LIMITED TO THE FACE
          VALUE OF THE ITEM OR TRANSACTION, OR THE ACTUAL VALUE OF ANY FUNDS NOT PROPERLY CREDITED OR DEBITED. IN NO EVENT
          WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU ADVISE US OF THE
          POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</li>
        <li>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any Services or the Service Provider Platform and disclaim all
          warranties, either express or implied or statutory, including, but not limited to, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for
          a particular purpose and lack of viruses related to the Services or the Service Provider Platform.</li>
        <li>Indemnification. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any losses, damages, suits and expenses, including
          reasonable attorneys’ fees, which we may incur as a result of: (i) taking any action or not taking any action that we are entitled to take
          pursuant to these Account Terms; (ii) any action or omission by you; or (iii) relying upon instructions or information from you.</li>
        <li>Disclaimer. ALL ACCOUNT FEATURES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
          IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
          PURPOSE.</li>
        <li>Reimbursement for Losses. If we take any action to collect debt incurred by you or other amounts you owe us under these
          Account Terms or defend ourselves in a lawsuit brought by you where we are the prevailing party, you agree to reimburse us for our
          losses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the extent permitted by applicable law. We may charge your
          Account for our losses without prior notice to you.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>N. Liability for Service Interruptions.</strong> From time to time, due to maintenance, malfunctions or failures of software, equipment, or
      telecommunications devices, as well as unusual transaction volume or similar reasons, access to your Account may not be available to you. We
      minimize the periods of time during which your Account is unavailable. Access to your Account may also be interrupted as a result of things
      beyond our reasonable control, computer failures, loss of power, failure or interruption of communication or transportation facilities, riots,
      strikes, or civil unrest. You agree that we shall not be responsible for any loss, damages, costs or expenses
      that you may suffer or incur, directly or indirectly, as a result of the unavailability of access to your Account, regardless of whether it could be
      shown that we could have prevented or reduced the duration of such unavailability by taking any action within our reasonable control. We shall
      also not be responsible for any loss, damages, costs or expenses which you may suffer or incur, directly or indirectly, as a result of your inability
      to access your Account caused directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by your computer or mobile device, your inability to establish a
      connection to or to access the Internet, or other limitations or constraints of the Internet. The provisions set forth in this section shall apply in
      addition to any other provisions in these Account Terms but as applied to service interruptions for access to your Account, this section shall
      control.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>O. Section Headings and Successors.</strong> The headings in these Account Terms are only for convenience and do not in any way limit or define
      your or our rights or obligations under these Account Terms. These Account Terms will be binding on your personal representatives, executors,
      administrators, and successors.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>P. Change of Address or any Application Information.</strong> You must notify us through the Service Provider Platform of any change of your
      address, email address or phone number or any material change to information that you have provided us in your application to open an
      Account. Any notice we provide to you will be binding and sent to the last (postal or electronic) address in our records. We may change your
      address if we receive an address change notice from the U.S. Postal Service or if a company in the business of providing correct addresses
      informs us that the address in our records no longer matches your address.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Q. Communications.</strong> You acknowledge that data, including emails, may be accessed by unauthorized third parties when communicated
      between you and the Bank, using the Internet, telephone, or other electronic devices. We are not responsible for any misdirected data or
      disclosures that occur as a result of your use of third-party electronic communication channels.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>R. Calls and Messages.</strong> You agree that we or our agents or service providers may contact you regarding any matter for any non
      telemarketing reason using any kind of telecommunications technology at any email and telephone number you provide to us, including the
      phone number for your mobile device. You agree to receive these calls and messages, including pre-recorded or auto-dialed calls. You also
      agree that we may send text messages to any phone number for your mobile device you provide to us. You understand and accept that your
      service provider may charge you for these calls and messages consistent with applicable law. For quality control purposes and for other
      reasons, you permit us to record and monitor your telephone conversations and electronic communications with us (including email). Unless
      the law requires otherwise, you consent in advance to such recording and monitoring and we do not need to remind you of these activities at
      the time of the call or communication. To revoke the consent provided pursuant to this subsection, you must send ten (10) days’ prior written
      notice of such revocation to 2955 Campus Drive #110, San Mateo 94403.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>S. Survival.</strong> Termination of these Account Terms shall not impact any right or obligation arising prior to termination, and in any event, the
      parties agree that any right or obligation which, by its nature, should survive termination of these Account Terms will survive any such
      termination (including, but not limited to Sections IV (Arbitration and Waivers) and V (Miscellaneous Terms) of these Account Terms).
    </p>

    <li>Tax Reporting and Backup Withholding.</li>

    <p>Unless you are exempt as described below, federal law requires that the Bank withhold a statutory amount of interest or dividend
      payments (referred to as backup withholding) if you (if your Account is an interest bearing account):</p>

    <ol class="agreement-list">
      <li>Fail to furnish a Taxpayer Identification Number (“TIN”),</li>
      <li>The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) notifies the Bank that you furnished an incorrect TIN,</li>
      <li>You or the Bank have been notified by the IRS that you are subject to backup withholding, or</li>
      <li>You failed to certify that you were not subject to backup withholding or you failed to certify that your TIN was correct.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If a correct TIN is not furnished at the time your account is opened, backup withholding will commence immediately. If you do not have a
      TIN assigned to you, IRS regulations allow a sixty (60) day grace period to obtain your TIN if you have completed the proper request for such
      grace period. Refer to the “Taxpayer Identification Number” section below for instructions on how to obtain a TIN.</p>

    <p>While you are waiting to be assigned a TIN, backup withholding will occur. After sixty days (60), if a certified TIN is not furnished, your
      account may be closed. If you furnish a correct TIN within sixty (60) of account opening, and prior to year-end, you may request a refund of
      the amount withheld for backup withholding.</p>

    <p>Certain additional IRS penalties may also apply if you fail to provide your TIN.</p>

    <p>For sole proprietorships, the Taxpayer Identification Number may be either a Social Security number or an Employer Identification
      Number. If a sole proprietor is a resident or nonresident alien, and is ineligible for a Social Security number, the Taxpayer Identification
      Number may be either an IRS “Individual Taxpayer Identification Number” (ITIN) or an Employer Identification Number (EIN). For corporations,
      estates, organizations, clubs, and trusts the Taxpayer Identification Number is their Employer Identification Number. If you do not have a
      Taxpayer Identification Number, obtain Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number (for businesses and all other entities), from
      the local IRS office, or Form W-7, Application for IRA Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (for sole proprietors who are resident or
      nonresident aliens). In addition, sole proprietors who are resident or nonresident aliens must also furnish a passport, or some other
      government document to verify identity.</p>

    <p>If you are exempt from backup withholding and information reporting, you must complete a certification to that effect provided by the
      Bank. It must also provide the Bank with its Taxpayer Identification Number to be considered exempt. The following lists payees that are exempt
      from backup withholding and information reporting. For interest and dividends, all listed payees are exempt except item 7 below. Payments
      subject to reporting under sections 6041 and 6041A are generally exempt from backup withholding only if made to payees described in items 1
      through 5 below, except that a corporation that provides medical and health care services or bills and collects payments from such services is
      not exempt from backup withholding or information reporting. Only payees described in items 2 through 5 below are exempt from backup
      withholding for barter exchange transactions, patronage dividends, and payments by certain fishing boat operators.</p>

    <ol class="agreement-list">
      <li>A corporation</li>
      <li>An organization exempt from tax under section 501(a), or an individual retirement plan (IRA), or a custodial account under
        403(b) (7)</li>
      <li>The United States or an agency or instrumentality thereof</li>
      <li>A state, the District of Columbia, a possession of the United States, or any political subdivision or instrumentality thereof</li>
      <li>A foreign government or a political subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof</li>
      <li>A futures commission merchant registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission</li>
      <li>A real estate investment trust</li>
      <li>An entity registered at all times during the tax year under the Investment Company Act of 1940</li>
      <li>A common trust fund operated by a bank under section 584(a)</li>
      <li>A financial institution</li>
      <li>A middleman known in the investment community as a nominee or listed in the most recent publication of the
        American Society of Corporate Secretaries, Inc. Nominee List</li>
      <li>A trust exempt from tax under section 664 or described in section 4947 Payments that are not subject to information
        reporting are also not subject to backup withholding. For details, see sections 6041, 6041(a), 6042, 6044, 6045, 6049, 6050A, 6050N,
        and 6050W of the Internal Revenue Code, and the Treasury Regulations under such sections.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code requires most recipients of dividends, interest, or other payments to give Taxpayer
      Identification Numbers to payors who must report payments to the Internal Revenue Service. The Internal Revenue Service uses the
      numbers for identification purposes and to verify the accuracy of your tax return. Payors must be given numbers whether or not recipients
      are required to file tax returns.</p>

    <p>If you fail to furnish a correct Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), you may be subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless
      such failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. If you fail to furnish a TIN, the Bank may refuse to open your Account. The
      Bank may close an Account which was opened without a TIN and you fail to subsequently provide a TIN.</p>

    <p>If you make a false statement with no reasonable basis that results in no imposition of backup withholding, you may be subject to a
      penalty of $500. Willfully falsifying certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines and/or imprisonment. If
      you disclose or use a TIN in violation of federal law, you may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.</p>

    <li>Fund Transfers.</li>

    <p>We may offer a variety of electronic banking services for your use with your Account. The purpose of this Section VII (Fund Transfer) is to
      inform you of some of the electronic banking services and also provide you with disclosures applicable to the services. We may also provide
      separate agreements to you that govern the terms of some services, including a separate agreement for Cards.</p>

    <p>Unless we have entered into a specific written agreement with you that provides otherwise, payment orders you give to us for the transfer
      of funds out of the Account by wire transfer or otherwise, and payment orders we receive for the transfer of funds into the Account, will be
      governed by this paragraph. In addition, your rights and obligations with respect to a payment order, and our rights and obligations, will be
      governed by (a) any separate written agreement with us; then (b) this section; and then, to the extent not specified in a separate written
      agreement or this Agreement; (c) by Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC 4A”) as enacted in Tennessee.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right to refuse to accept any payment order. Payment orders are accepted when they are executed by us. We may process
      any payment order request (as well as any amendment or cancellation request concerning a payment order) that we believe is transmitted or
      authorized by you if we act in compliance with a security procedure agreed upon by you and us. Such payment orders will be deemed
      effective as if made by you, and you will be obligated to pay us in the amount of such orders, even though they are not transmitted or
      authorized by you. Unless we agree on another security procedure, you agree that we may confirm the authenticity and content of a payment
      order (among other ways) by placing a telephone call to you. If we cannot reach you, or if the payment order is not confirmed or approved in
      the manner we require, we may refuse to execute the payment order.</p>

    <p>You agree that if a payment order or cancellation thereof identifies the beneficiary by both name and an identity number, and the name
      and number identify different persons or account holders, execution and payment to the beneficiary or cancellation may be made solely on the
      basis of the identifying number. You also agree that if a payment order identifies an intermediary bank or the beneficiary’s bank by both name
      and an identifying number, and the name and number identify different persons, execution of the payment order by any bank may be made
      solely on the basis of the identifying number. If we receive a funds transfer into any Account you have with us, we are not required to give you
      any notice of the receipt of the funds transfer. The funds transfer will appear on your next periodic statement. To confirm the completion of
      funds transfers, please contact us at [INSERT NUMBER] or access your Account using the Service Provider Platform. Prior to the acceptance of
      an outgoing payment order, the outgoing payment order may be cancelled, but may not be amended or modified, if the beneficiary’s bank is
      located within the United States of America and the outgoing payment order is to be paid in U.S. dollars. Other outgoing payment orders may
      not be cancelled, amended or modified. We must receive your cancellation in a reasonable time prior to the time we execute the outgoing
      payment order. Payment orders sent by Fedwire will be subject to the Federal Reserve’s Regulation J, and payment orders sent via other
      payment systems will be subject to the rules of those systems. You agree that we may record all telephone conversations and data transmissions
      received from, made for or made on behalf of you pursuant to or in connection with a payment order.</p>

    <p>You agree that if a payment order, or any cancellation or authorization relating thereto, but for the applicability of the Electronic Fund
      Transfer Act of 1978, constitutes a portion of a funds transfer as defined in UCC 4A, all actions and disputes concerning such payment order,
      cancellation or authorization shall be determined pursuant to UCC 4A and these Account Terms to the full extent permitted by law. If an
      outgoing payment order in a foreign currency cannot be completed, the exchange rate that will apply to any refund due you will be the
      exchange rate in effect at the time on the day the refund is made. Additional fees may be deducted from a payment order amount by other
      banks involved in the funds transfer process.</p>

    <p>We may route payment at our own discretion for each outgoing wire transfer. A wire transfer is irrevocable once payment has been
      transmitted to the beneficiary’s bank. At your request, we may request that the beneficiary’s bank return funds previously transferred.
      However, you acknowledge that the beneficiary’s bank is under no obligation to comply with this request.</p>

    <p>Other electronic transactions against your Account, whether or not initiated or authorized by you will be governed by the specific
      Agreement between us related to such transactions and/or all applicable rules and regulations governing such transactions, including
      without limitation, the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association (“NACHA”) as may be amended from time to time.</p>

    <p>Under NACHA rules we cannot return an unauthorized electronic transaction (ACH debit) unless you notify us no later than 5:00 p.m.
      Central Time on the business day following the settlement date of the transaction. Otherwise, your sole recourse is to the originator of the
      transaction.</p>

    <p>Your Account is also subject to transfer limitations. The transfer limit depends on the EFT type. If a Card is made available to you, it is
      subject to a purchase and withdrawal limit of $[X] per day. The Card may be further limited based on fraud risk and security of the Account. All
      EFTs are subject to limits. Such EFT limits include limits on ATM withdrawals, cash advances and PIN or signature-based purchases. ACH
      Transfers to external accounts are also subject to limits on the dollar amount of electronic transfers between your Account and external
      accounts at other financial institutions, including Linked Accounts. All limits described here are designed to be flexible in order to protect the
      security and integrity of the service and accounts, including the Account, as well as you and all other users of the service. These limitations
      may be based on confidential fraud and risk criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of you and the integrity of
      the service and all Accounts and may be modified at our sole discretion without advance notice.</p>

    <li>Deposit Availability.</li>

    <p>When a deposit is made to your Account, the funds may not be available immediately. This Section VIII (Deposit Availability
      Disclosure) describes when funds will be made available to you.</p>

    <ol class="agreement-list">
      <li><strong>A. Delays.</strong> We may delay the availability of funds from certain types of deposits to your Account. There are exceptions that may apply in
        certain circumstances (e.g., if you have overdrawn your Account repeatedly in the last six months or there is an emergency). During the delay,
        you may not withdraw funds and may not use the funds. Interest will be paid on deposits we receive, even if the funds are not yet available for
        withdrawal. We will notify you if we delay the availability of your funds, and we will tell you when you can expect your funds to be available.</li>
      <li><strong>B. Day of Deposits.</strong> Any transaction that you conduct on Saturday, Sunday, a federal holiday, or other days on which we are closed will
        be handled the following business day. If we receive a deposit before 4:00 PM MT on a business day, we will consider that business day to
        be the day of your deposit. However, if we receive a deposit after 4:00 PM MT or on a non-business day, we will consider the deposit as
        having been made the next business day.</li>
      <li><strong>C. Special Rules for New Accounts.</strong> If you are a new customer, the following special rules will apply during the first 30 days your account is
        open. Funds from electronic direct deposits to your Account will be available on the day we receive the deposit. Funds from deposits of cash,
        wire transfers, and, if made available, the first $5,000 of a day's total deposits of cashier's, certified, teller's, traveler's,
        and federal, state and local government checks will be available on the same business day we receive your deposit if the deposit meets certain
        conditions. For example, the checks must be payable to you (and you may have to use a special deposit slip). The excess over $5,000 will be
        available on the ninth business day after the day of your deposit. If your deposit of these checks (other than a U.S. Treasury check) is not made
        in person to one of our associates, the first $5,000 may not be available until the second business day after the day of your deposit. Funds
        from all other check deposits may not be available until the second business day after the day of your deposit.</li>
      <li><strong>D. Availability of ACH Transfer and EFT Deposits.</strong> Funds from wire deposits are available on the business day we receive the deposit.
        Funds from ACH Transfers or EFTs that you initiate through another bank will generally be available on the next business day after the day the
        ACH Transfer is deemed to be received by us. An ACH Transfer or EFT debit to a Linked Account or any other external account that we
        originate on your behalf will generally be made available on the third business day after the date the ACH Transfer or EFT is deemed to be
        received by us. Once they are available, you can use the funds for EFTs and ACH Transfers. Even after we have made funds available to you
        and you have withdrawn the funds, you remain responsible if any deposit to your Account is returned, rejected, or otherwise uncollected by
        Bank.</li>

<strong>EVOLVE BANK & TRUST CUSTOMER ACCOUNT TERMS</strong>

<div class="agreement__text wysiwyg">
  <ol class="bold-items">
    <li>INTRODUCTION.</li>

    <p>This document, as amended or supplemented by the attached disclosures, (collectively, the “Account Terms”) contains the
      general terms, conditions and disclosures for the Evolve Bank & Trust transaction account (the “Account”) and constitutes
      an agreement between the Bank (as defined below) and you. For purpose of these Account Terms, the term “Account” may
      also collectively include Sub-Deposit Accounts.</p>

    <p>References to the “Bank,” “we,” “us,” or “our” means Evolve Bank & Trust and any of its affiliates. References to “you” and
      “your” means you and any person that holds, whether individually, jointly or on behalf of another person, the Account. The
      Account Terms may be supplemented or amended as set forth in Section V(E) (Miscellaneous Terms). Bank services and
      access and use of your Account may be provided to you through the website and/or mobile phone application of our
      service provider (the “Service Provider,” and its website and mobile phone application, the “Service Provider Platform”).
      The Service Provider may offer you additional services through its Service Provider Platform, pursuant and subject to the
      terms and conditions between you and the Service Provider (the “Services” and such terms and conditions, the “Service
      Provider Terms”). Please see Section II(D) (The Account) for additional information.</p>

    <p>By opening or continuing to maintain an Account with us, you agree to be bound by these Account Terms, and all applicable
      agreements, disclosures, and other documents, as well as by all applicable federal or state laws, statutes and regulations.
      Please keep a copy of these Account Terms.</p>

    <p>We may decline to open an Account for any reason, or for no reason. We are not liable for any damages or liabilities
      resulting from refusal of an Account relationship.</p>

    <strong class="heading">THESE ACCOUNT TERMS IS SUBJECT TO MANDATORY ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND A
      WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION AND JURY PROVISION. PLEASE CAREFULLY READ SECTION IV (ARBITRATION AND WAIVERS).</strong>

    <li>The Account.</li>

    <p>
      <strong>A. Availability.</strong> The Account is available to United States citizens or lawful permanent residents with a U.S. physical address
      or with military addresses (APO or FPO) who are at least 18 years old with a valid Social Security Number. To open an
      Account, you must provide any information we may request from time to time. Each owner of an Account shall have a
      continuing obligation to provide any other documentation we may request from time to time, including any information
      required under our customer identification program to establish your identity.
    </p>

    <p>The Account is only available for personal, family or household purposes and not for business purposes. You are not
      entitled to open an Account under these Account Terms if you are a corporation, unincorporated business association,
      partnership, limited liability company, incorporated nonprofit organization or sole proprietorship. We reserve the right to
      close your Account if we determine that it is used for any impermissible purpose, as we may determine from time to time.
      You must also agree to go paperless. This means that: (1) you must keep us supplied with your valid email address and
      telephone number; and (2) you must agree to accept electronic delivery of all communications that we need or decide to
      send you. Please see the Evolve Bank & Trust Electronic Communication Consent for additional details. [Insert Hyperlink to
      Evolve Electronic Communications-Consent]</p>

    <p>
      <strong>B. Account Type and Ownership.</strong> The Account is a transaction account that pays a variable rate of interest and allows you
      to make certain payments and transfers to third parties. The Account may not be opened as a joint account. You cannot
      give a security interest or pledge your Account to someone other than us without first getting our express written consent.
      We are not required to give consent to a security interest or pledge to someone else. Unless we agree in a separate writing
      otherwise a security interest or pledge to someone else must be satisfied or released before any right to withdraw from the
      account can be exercised.

      to make certain payments and transfers to third parties. The Account may not be opened as a joint account. You cannot
      give a security interest or pledge your Account to someone other than us without first getting our express written consent.

      otherwise a security interest or pledge to someone else must be satisfied or released before any right to withdraw from the
      account can be exercised.
    </p>

    <p>To open an Account, you must submit to us an application and all information that we may
      require. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires us to
      obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an Account. This means that when you open an
      Account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may
      also ask to see other identifying documents, such as a driver’s license. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide the
      information necessary to verify your identity, the Account may be blocked or closed, which may result in additional fees
      assessed to the Account.</p>

    <p>By opening an Account, you agree that we can gather your personal information from one or more consumer reporting
      agencies, governmental entities and/or other third parties. You also agree that we have the right to access follow-up
      consumer reports while your Account is open for maintenance, review or collection purposes.</p>

    <p>Your Account will not be considered "opened" until it is funded. This means your balance must be at least a penny. Once
      your account is considered “opened,” there is no minimum balance required and no maximum balance limit. However, we
      may, at our sole discretion and at any time, require a minimum balance and set a maximum balance limit.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>D. Service Providers.</strong> You understand that we have engaged Service Providers to perform a number of services for you
      under these Account Terms, including, but not limited to, identity verification, compliance monitoring, risk mitigation,
      managing your transfer instructions and other related services. Service Providers, along with their partners and agents, are
      the servicer of your Account. In that capacity, Service Provider may act on our behalf, perform our obligations or enforce
      our rights under these Account Terms. A Service Provider may also offer Services in connection with your Account to allow
      you to provide us with payment instructions and to view certain Account information using the Service Provider Platform.
      You understand that any payment instruction or activity performed using the Services shall be deemed authorized and valid
      and Bank is under no obligation to investigate the instruction or activity.
    </p>

    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we will not have any liability in connection with the Services and disclaim all
      warranties, either express or implied or statutory, including, but not limited to, any implied warranties of merchantability,
      fitness for a particular purpose and lack of viruses related to the Services. In no event shall we be liable for: (1) damages
      caused other than by our own gross negligence or intentional misconduct; or (2) indirect, special, incidental, consequential
      or punitive damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for lost profits, disclosure of confidential
      information, or loss of privacy) arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Services, even if we
      have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>


    <li>Using Your Account and Account Disclosures.</li>

    <p>
      <strong>A. Debit Card.</strong> In connection with your Account, we may (but are not obligated to) issue you a debit card (the “Card”) that
      will automatically link to the Account. If a Card is made available to you, it is subject to a debit card agreement by and
      between you and us. The Card may be used to initiate withdrawals at ATMs and points of sale and may be used to purchase
      goods and services. By using your Card, you authorize us and/or our agents to debit your Account. We reserve the right to
      refuse to make any transfer for security, credit, legal/regulatory, or other reasons, as we determine in our sole discretion.
      You are responsible for all transactions you authorize using the Card, including any losses, charges, or penalties incurred as
      a result. You may be charged for your use of the Card at ATMs. The Card is the property of the Bank, and if your Account is
      closed or your Card privileges are cancelled, you agree to stop using the Card and destroy it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>B. Linking Accounts.</strong> You may link your bank account at another financial institution (“Linked Account”) to your Account in
      order to transfer funds between your Linked Account and your Account. You represent and warrant: (1) that you have the
      right to authorize any and all charges and debits to the Linked Account; (2) the Linked Account is held at a depository
      institution located in the U.S.; and (3) you are individually or jointly the owner of the Linked Account. You will indemnify
      and hold us harmless from any claims by any person related to the Linked Account, including any other owner of the Linked
      Account. You are not permitted to link your Account with a credit, debit, gift, or other type of card issued by a third party or
      another bank. You may deposit funds into or withdraw funds from your Account by using the Service Provider Platform to
      initiate an Automated Clearing House transfer (“ACH Transfer”) to or from the Linked Account. We do not accept requests
      made otherwise to initiate ACH Transfers. Requests for ACH Transfers to debit the Linked Account that are made before
      4:00 PM MT on a business day, shall be considered received on the business day the request is made. Requests for ACH
      Transfers to debit the Linked Account that are made after 4:00 PM MT on a business day or on a non-business day, shall be
      considered received the next business day.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>C. ACH Transfer Initiated by an External Bank or Through a Third Party.</strong> You may deposit funds into or withdraw funds
      from your Account by having an external bank (directly or through a third party) initiate an ACH Transfer to or from your
      Account at the Bank. The external account that you are depositing funds into or withdrawing funds from must be at an
      external bank located in the U.S.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>D. Internal Transfer Between Accounts at the Bank.</strong> We may (but are not obligated to) permit you to initiate a transfer of
      funds between your accounts at the Bank through a Service Provider Platform. We do not accept requests made otherwise
      to initiate internal transfers.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>E. Deposits.</strong> When you make a deposit, we will act only as your collection agent and will not be responsible beyond the
      exercise of good faith and ordinary care. All deposits are provisionally credited subject to our receipt of final payment. If a
      deposit or transfer of funds into your Account is returned or rejected by the paying financial institution for any reason, you
      agree that we may deduct the amount of the deposit or transfer against your Account, without prior written notice to you.

      <ol class="agreement-list">
        <li>You may make a deposit into your Account by ACH Transfers or any other method we make available to you. You
          may also arrange for recurring deposits, such as direct deposits, to be made electronically to your Account.</li>
        <li>Foreign Currency and Cash Deposits. We do not accept any deposits denominated in any foreign currency. We
          do not accept any deposits in cash, whether in U.S. dollars or any foreign currency. All deposits are considered to
          be non-cash deposits.</li>
        <li>If we permit you to deposit a check into your Account, you agree not to deposit a check drawn on the same
          Account into which the check is being deposited. If available, you also agree not to deposit by ATM, mobile
          banking check deposit, or by mail any item that is drawn on a foreign bank or that is not denominated in US
          dollars. We may refuse a deposit, limit the amount of a deposit or return all or a portion of a deposit. We are not
          responsible for any deposit you mail to us that we do not receive. We will forward any items you deposit for
          collection to the bank on which the items are drawn. We may give you provisional credit for any item you deposit,
          which we may revoke at any time if we do not receive final payment for that item. All deposits to your Accounts,
          regardless of how made, are subject to verification, final payment, and our Deposit Availability Disclosure.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>F.</strong> You may only deposit with us funds that are immediately available, which under applicable law are irreversible and are
      not subject to any lien, claim or encumbrance.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>G. Withdrawals.</strong>

      <ol class="agreement-list">
        <li>Except as provided below, you may make withdrawals from your Account up to the available balance in your
          Account by any means that we make available to you. We may refuse a withdrawal request exceeding the available
          funds in your Account even if you make a deposit later in the business day after we refuse your withdrawal
          request. If your available balance is not enough to pay a transaction you make, we may assess an insufficient or
          unavailable funds fee, regardless of whether we pay the transaction. We may allow withdrawals at any time, but
          reserve the right to require seven (7) days written notice of intention to withdraw funds from your Account if your
          Account is a negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) account.</li>
        <li>You are not permitted to make withdrawals from your Account by creating a check drawn on your Account. If
          you attempt to make any transactions with your Account using a credit, debit, gift or other type of card issued by a
          third party or another bank or by creating a check drawn on your Account, we will reject and/or return the
          transaction without notice to you and may consider such action to be a violation by you of these Account Terms.</li>
        <li>Before allowing a transaction, we may request you to provide us with identification, authorization,
          documentation or other information that we deem necessary. We may refuse a withdrawal if you fail to comply
          with our request. We may tell you in advance when we are going to refuse a withdrawal request but will not be
          required to do so.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>H. Payment Instructions.</strong>

      <ol class="agreement-list">
        <li>You agree that any payment instructions received by us (such as requests to withdraw or transfer funds from
          your Account) through the Service Provider Platform or in connection with your username, passphrase, PIN or
          mobile device used to access the Service Provider Platform (collectively “Credentials”) will be deemed to be
          authorized by you. The use of any of your Credentials by another person will be as effective as your use of the
          Credentials, regardless of whether the person affixing the Credential was authorized by you and regardless of the
          means by which the Credential was affixed. For example, if you provide your username and password used to
          access the Service Provider Platform to another person and that person uses that information to withdraw funds
          from your Account, we will deem the withdrawal to be authorized by you. Unless prohibited by applicable law, you
          agree to hold us harmless and indemnify us for any liability incurred for reasonably acting upon such instructions
          which bear any of your Credentials. You agree to keep confidential and to take all reasonable precautions and
          make all reasonable efforts to protect the secrecy of all Credentials issued to you, selected by you, or utilized by
          you. If any of your Credentials become lost or known to another person, you agree to notify us immediately so that
          a replacement may be issued. If you believe your Credentials are no longer secure or confidential, or that someone
          has used your Credentials without your permission, please contact us immediately by calling +1 (888) 610-2324 or
          notifying us through the Service Provider Platform.</li>
        <li>We may refuse to follow any of your payment instructions if we think they are illegal or potentially harmful to
          us. If we follow your payment instructions, we may require other security measures to protect us from any losses
          we may suffer. To the greatest extent permitted by law. you agree to pay us back for any damages or losses
          (including, but not limited to, the reasonable costs of an attorney) that we suffer if we take an action based on

      <strong>I. Posting Order of Credits and Debits.</strong>

      <ol class="agreement-list">
        <li><p><strong>Posting Orders.</strong> This section summarizes how we generally post some common transactions to your Account.
          Posting transactions to your Account impact your Account balance. Posting a credit increases your balance, while
          posting a debit or hold reduces your balance. Credits include deposits and credits we make. Holds include deposit
          holds, Card authorizations and holds related to withdrawals and EFTs (as defined below). Debits include
          withdrawals, transfers, payments, Card transactions and fees.</p>

          <p>We use automated systems to process transactions and then to post transactions to your Account. When we
          process multiple transactions for your Account on the same day, you agree that we may in our discretion
          determine our posting orders for the transactions and that we may credit, authorize, accept, pay, decline or return
          credits, debits and holds in any order at our option.</p>

          <p>We generally post common transaction as follows. We group the different types of transactions into categories.
          We use several different categories for holds, credits, and debits. Most categories include more than one
          transaction type. After the end of the business day, our automated systems assign each transaction received for
          that day to a category. We generally post all transactions within a category, using the posting order or orders that
          apply to that category, before we post any transactions assigned to the next category.</p>

          <p>First, we start with the balance in your Account at the beginning of the business day, subtract holds from your
          balance, and make any adjustments from prior days. Next, we generally add available deposits and credits to your
          balance and then subtract debits from your balance based on the debit category. We subtract debits in a category
          from your balance in order from the highest to lowest dollar amount, unless specified otherwise herein. The first
          category of debits to be applied against your balance are certain Card and ATM transactions (e.g., Card
          transactions and ATM withdrawals and transfers). The debits within this category are subtracted from your
          balance in date and time order our systems receive date and time information. If we make checks available to you,
          this category is applied next against your balance. Check posting will be in sequential order based on the check
          number, and for any check for which the number cannot be read, from highest to lowest amount following the
          posting of number legible checks. We then subtract from your balance any other types of electronic debits in order
          from the highest to lowest dollar amount. These debits include ACH Transfers. Finally, we subtract from your
          balance most fees (such as monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, returned item fees, and ATM fees) in order
          from highest to lowest dollar amount. Some fees may show as “processing” until the next day.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Changing Posting Orders.</strong> You agree that we may determine in our discretion the orders in which we post
          transactions to your Account. You agree that we may determine in our discretion the categories, the transactions
          within a category, the order among categories and the posting orders within a category. We sometimes add or
          delete categories, change posting orders within categories and move transaction types among categories. You
          agree that we may in our discretion make these changes at any time without notice to you.</li>
        <li><strong>Posting Orders Determined at End of Day.</strong> We receive credits, debits and holds throughout the day. Regardless
          of when during the day we receive transactions for your Account, you agree that we may treat them as if we
          received all transactions at the same time at the end of the business day. During the day, we show some
          transactions as processing. Please note that transactions shown as processing have not been posted yet. The
          posting order for these transactions is determined at the end of the day, with the other transactions we receive for
          that day and based on the category. We do not always receive debits on the same day that you conduct them. We
          generally post credits and debits to your Account, and report them on your statement, in a different order than the
          order in which you conduct them or we receive them.</li>
        <li><strong>Overdraft Fees.</strong> We generally determine at the time we post a debit to your Account whether it creates an
          overdraft and whether an overdraft or returned item fee applies. You should note that sometimes we authorize a
          transaction at a time when you have enough available funds to cover it, but because other transactions post
          before it and reduce your balance, the transaction creates an overdraft when we post it to your Account. You can
          avoid fees for overdrafts and returned items by making sure that your Account always contains enough available
          funds to cover all of your transactions. When your Account balance includes some funds that are subject to a hold,
          dispute or legal process, you should note that those funds are not available to cover your transactions. Our posting
          orders can impact the number of overdraft fees we charge you when you do not have enough available funds to
          cover all of your transactions. When several debits arrive the same business day for payment from your Account
          and you do not have enough available funds in your Account to cover all of the debits we receive for that day, you
          understand that some posting orders can result in more overdrafts, and more fees for overdraft items and
          returned items, than if we had used other posting orders. You agree that we may in our discretion choose our
          posting orders, and also change them from time to time, regardless of whether additional fees may result. When
          your Account balance includes some funds that are not available at the time that we post a debit, and you do not
          have enough available funds in your Account to cover the debit, the debit results in an overdraft and we generally
          charge you an overdraft fee or returned item fee for the debit. We do not show holds or distinguish between
          available and unavailable funds in your Account balance on your statement.</li>
        <li><strong>Certain Transactions Made After Business Day Ends.</strong> During processing, we generally include in your Account
          balance some transactions that you make after the business day cut-off, but before the end of the calendar day.
          Deposits are made available based on Section VIII (Deposit Availability Disclosure). We generally subtract from
          your Account balance the following debits, when the transaction occurs after the cutoff time for the business day,
          but during the same calendar day: cash withdrawals made at an ATMs and any credit-push ACH Transfers of EFTs.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>J. Insurance Coverage.</strong> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insures deposits according to the ownership
      category in which the funds are insured. Not all accounts may be insured. Unless otherwise stated by us or the FDIC, the
      Account is insured by the FDIC up to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount per depositor, per FDIC-insured
      bank, and per ownership category (the “Standard Insurance Amount” or “SIA”). For purposes of determining the SIA
      applicable to your Account, you need to consider all accounts that you also hold at the Bank. To determine SIA applicable to
      your Account with us and for any other FDIC insurance requirements that may apply, please visit the FDIC’s website at
      www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits or call the FDIC directly at 1-877- ASKFDIC (1-877-275-3342). You can also use the FDIC’s
      Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator (EDIE) at www.fdic.gov/edie. Please see subsection L below for additional
      information regarding FDIC insurance coverage for Sub-Deposit Accounts.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>K. Court Processes and Claims Against your Account.</strong> If we receive a levy, attachment, or other legal process against you or
      any party to your Account, we may refuse to permit withdrawals or transfers from your Account until the legal process is
      dismissed or satisfied. Any levy, attachment, or other legal process will be subject to our right of set-off and security
      interest. You are responsible for any losses, costs, or expenses we incur as a result of any dispute or legal proceeding
      involving your Account. If we receive a claim against the funds in your Account, or if we know of or believe that there‘s a
      dispute as to the ownership or control of funds in your Account, we may, in our discretion: (1) place a hold on your Account
      and refuse to pay out any funds until we‘re satisfied that the dispute is settled; (2) close your Account and send the balance
      to the named account holder(s); (3) require a court order to act; or (4) take any other action we feel is necessary to protect
      us. We will not be liable to you for taking any such action.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>L. Statements.</strong> We will deliver or make available to your periodic statements for your Account at least four (4) times a year,
      unless your Account is determined to be inactive. The Account statement will describe payments or transfers made in
      connection with your Account. You agree to notify us promptly if you do not receive your statement by the date you
      normally would expect to receive it. Your periodic statement may be accompanied by items or a facsimile of those items
      listed on the statement, unless the item or an image of the item is unavailable for any reason. You agree that the statement
      and items all have been delivered or made available to you in a reasonable manner. We will not be responsible for any
      indirect, special or consequential damages under any circumstances for our inability to provide copies of an item. Our
      liability, if any, will not exceed the face amount of an item in question.
    </p>

    <p>Our records regarding your Account will be deemed correct unless you timely establish with us that we made an error. You
      are obligated to examine your Account statement promptly and carefully to determine if there were any errors,
      unauthorized transactions or any other improper or disputed transactions on your Account (collectively referred to as
      “Exceptions”). You must notify us within thirty (30) days after we have sent or made your Account statement available to
      you of any Exception on your Account. You must notify us within six (6) months after we have sent or made your Account
      statement available to you if you identify any unauthorized, missing or altered endorsements on your items. Electronic fund
      transfers are subject to different time periods for notification of errors. Please refer to Section VII (Electronic Fund Transfer
      Disclosure) for information regarding erroneous electronic fund transfers. If you fail to notify us of an Exception within the
      time frames specified herein, your Account statement will be considered correct. We will not be liable for the Exceptions in
      this Account statement. Except as provided by applicable law, you also agree that we will not be required to reimburse you
      for any Exceptions caused by your own negligence. If you timely report an Exception, we will investigate the Exception.</p>

    <p>After you submit a claim under this subsection, we may require you to: (1) complete and return a form detailing the
      Exception; (2) provide us with any and all requested documents we may require; (3) notify law enforcement; and (4)
      cooperate fully with us in our investigation. We may reverse any credit we make available to your Account resulting from
      the Exception claim if you fail to cooperate with us in our investigation or recovery efforts, or if we determine the
      transaction was authorized. You agree to repay us promptly any amount credited to your Account in error, and you
      authorize us to debit your Account to obtain payment of any erroneous credit. Different rules may apply to electronic fund
      transfers. For specific information on unauthorized electronic fund transfers, please refer to Section VII (Electronic Fund
      Transfer Disclosure).</p>

    <p>
      <strong>M. Sub-Deposit Accounts.</strong> We will, from time to time, place your funds provided to us in a deposit account or omnibus
      custody account (“Sub-Deposit Account”) with other depository institutions (each an “Insured Depository Institution”). You
      will not be charged a fee for our placement of your funds or in connection with the Sub-Deposit Account. We also will act as
      the agent/custodian with respect to your Sub-Deposit Account pursuant to this subsection. You consent to us placing funds
      with Insured Depository Institutions. If you do not consent to our placement of funds with Insured Depository Institutions,
      you should not open an Account or deposit funds with us.
    </p>

    <p>The Sub-Deposit Account will be established by an Insured Depository Institution that has entered into agreements with us.
      Your funds in the Sub-Deposit Account will bear the interest rates and APY you have agreed to with us (if any). All payments
      with respect to the Sub-Deposit Account by the Insured Depository Institutions will be made to us, and we will credit the
      funds to your Account.</p>

    <p>Your only rights with respect to the Sub-Deposit Account is to demand we repay you all amounts in your Account, including
      those transferred to the Sub-Deposit Account. The Sub-Deposit Account may not be transferred to another institution,
      except by us or the Insured Depository Institution. You may terminate our role as your agent/custodian and our ability to
      deposit funds you provide us in the Sub-Deposit Account. Any termination will result in a return of funds in accordance with
      law and closing of your Account and any Sub-Deposit Account opened specifically for you.</p>

    <p>When we place funds with Insured Depository Institution and act as your agent with respect to the Sub-Deposit Account,
      we will ensure the records of the Insured Depository Institution are in our name, as agent or custodian. The funds deposited
      in the Sub-Deposit Account will be FDIC insured to the same extent as if such funds were held in the Account with us. In
      other words, the depositing of your funds into the Sub-Deposit Account will not otherwise increase your FDIC deposit
      insurance coverage. You will not receive any written confirmation of the establishment of the Sub-Deposit Account or
      transfer of funds to the Sub-Deposit Account; instead, we will maintain records clearly indicating the transfer and beneficial
      ownership of the Sub-Deposit Account. You must immediately report to us any changes in Account ownership information
      that you originally provided to us in connection with the submission of your application for an Account.</p>

    <p>Our placing of funds may reflect considerations of federal and state law, our funding needs and funding needs of Insured
      Depository Institutions, general economic conditions or other factors determined by us in our sole discretion. We will not
      place funds with more than one Insured Depository Institution. We may place funds to enhance our business objectives and
      for balance sheet management without any benefit to you, including increased FDIC deposit insurance coverage. Further,
      we may receive greater benefits when we place your funds with an Insured Depository Institution than if we otherwise
      maintained your funds with us. We are under no obligation to place your funds with an Insured Depository Institution.
      A Sub-Deposit Account will be a deposit obligation of the Insured Depository Institution that maintains the Sub-Deposit
      Account; provided, this does not modify our obligation to repay all amounts you deposited in your Account.</p>

    <p>All deposits that are maintained with an Insured Depository Institution in the Sub-Deposit Account are aggregated with
      deposits maintained in your Account with us for purposes of the SIA. Funds you hold in one or more Accounts with us
      (including funds we maintain before placement with Insured Depository Institution), funds in the Sub-Deposit Account and
      any funds resulting from payment of interests on an Sub- Deposit Account will be aggregated for FDIC insurance purposes
      with all other deposits you hold in deposit accounts with us in the same ownership category and therefore may not be fully
      insured by the FDIC. For the avoidance of doubt, funds deposited in the Sub-Deposit Account will be treated as funds on
      deposit in the Account with us for FDIC insurance calculation purposes. As such, your total FDIC deposit insurance coverage
      for funds you provide us for deposit in your Account will not be increased by nature of any deposit of funds in the SubDeposit Account. Please see subjection J above for additional information on determining SIA.</p>

    <p>We may provide your name, tax identification number and other pertinent identifying information to Insured Depository
      Institution, and other parties providing services in connection with the placement of your funds and the establishing and
      holding the Sub-Deposit Account. You hereby consent to such release of information. Nothing in this section shall be
      deemed to prevent us from disclosing information to a third party if required by law.</p>

    <p>We will act as your agent in connection with the placement of your funds with the Insured Depository Institution and the
      establishment and maintenance of the Sub-Deposit Account. Although we will act as your limited agent in connection with
      the placement of your funds, we are not acting as your financial adviser. See subsection A of Section V for additional
      information. You hereby appoint us to act as your agent for purposes of placing funds with Insured Depository Institutions
      and establishing and maintaining, on your behalf, the Sub-Deposit Account. You further authorize us to collect for you all
      interest and other payments related to a Sub- Deposit Account, to place funds with Insured Depository Institution pursuant
      to the terms set forth herein, and to execute and deliver or file on your behalf all appropriate receipts, agreements,
      releases and other instruments, including whatever agreements may be required from Insured Depository Institution, for
      the purpose of establishing your ownership interest in the Sub-Deposit Account and maintaining a Sub- Deposit Account.</p>

    <p>Although there are two or more accounts associated with your funds (the account maintained with us, referred to as the
      Account, and the Sub-Deposit Account), your Account is considered a single account for your deposits and withdrawals, as
      well as for tax reporting, balance requirement, service charge, monthly statement and FDIC deposit insurance purposes.</p>

    <p>The existence of the Sub-Deposit Account and any other account maintained by us pursuant to these Account Terms is for
      internal purposes and will not change the manner in which you use, obtain information about or earn interest (if any) on
      your Account. These transfers, including the placement transfer, will not appear on your monthly statement.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>N. Interest and Interest Rate.</strong> If your Account is an interest-bearing account, the following provisions apply. A minimum
      deposit of $1.00 is required to earn the Annual Percentage Yield (“APY”) disclosed to you from time to time. We only pay
      interest in whole cents and use standard rounding rules to calculate the amount of interest earned. This means that an
      amount equal to or greater than one half of one cent accrued during a monthly interest period is rounded up to the next
      whole cent and an amount less than one half of one cent accrued during a monthly interest period is rounded down to
      zero. Interest is compounded daily and credited to your Account monthly. Interest is calculated using the daily balance
      method. This method applies a daily periodic rate to the principal and interest that has accrued in the Account each day.
      This means that the interest from your Account is calculated every day on a 365-day year (and 366-day for leap year).
    </p>

    <p>Interest begins to accrue on the business day that we receive your deposit. If the Account is closed before interest is
      credited, accrued interest will be paid through the last full day before the day the Account is closed. The rate at which
      interest may be paid on the principal balance of the Account, and the corresponding APY at which the Account would earn
      interest each year if all interest paid on the Account remains in the Account, can be found on the Service Provider Platform,
      which may be modified by from time to time in our sole discretion. We may, at our discretion, at any time, change the
      interest rate and the APY.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>O. Prohibitions.</strong> You must not use your Card or Account for any illegal purpose or internet gambling. This prohibition
      includes any transaction that is illegal in the jurisdiction where you live, in the jurisdiction where the transaction is
      consummated, or in any other jurisdiction affected by the transaction. You are responsible for determining the legality of
      each of your transactions in all applicable jurisdictions before entering into the transaction. We have no obligation to
      monitor, review or evaluate the legality of any transaction. Nevertheless, we may deny transactions or authorizations if we
      believe the transaction is or may be illegal. We reserve the right to refuse or return any item that we believe is related to an
      illegal transaction, an Internet or online gambling transaction or a high-risk transaction. To the fullest extent permitted by
      law, you agree to pay for any item or transfer that you authorized, even if the transaction related to that item or transfer is
      determined to be illegal.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>P. Fees.</strong> You agree to pay all fees and charges applicable to your Accounts, which will be automatically deducted from your
      Accounts and may result in your Accounts being overdrawn. The amounts of these fees and charges, the manner in which
      they are calculated, and the ways to potentially avoid them are listed in our Fee Schedule. Fees and our Fee Schedule are
      subject to change at any time and without notice to you, unless required by law. Fees set forth in the Fee Schedule are
      charged by Bank for its services. Service Provider may charge you fees separate and apart from the fees set forth in the Fee
      Schedule for its Services, pursuant to the Service Provider Terms. Bank is not responsible for any fees charged by Service
      Provider for its Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Q. Power of Attorney/Agents.</strong> Subject to applicable law, you may not give another person (called an “attorney in fact”)
      authority to act on your behalf, unless permitted by us. Unless we agree to in writing, we are not required to honor orders
      and instructions concerning your Account by an attorney in fact for any Account Owner, or by a personal representative,
      guardian, conservator, or custodian of an account owner. If we approve your appointment of an attorney in fact, we have
      no duty to monitor or ensure that the acts of your attorney in fact are for your use or benefit or are otherwise permissible
      under applicable law. We will not be liable if your attorney in fact exceeds his or her powers or does not comply with your
      instructions or applicable law. We may terminate acceptance of a power of attorney at any time and for any reason and
      without notice to you. You agree to hold us harmless from and against any actions we take based upon the instructions of
      your attorney in fact or that your attorney in fact takes regarding your Account, unless or until we receive and have had a
      reasonable opportunity to act on written notice that you have died or that the power of attorney has been revoked.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>R. Death, Incapacity or Termination.</strong> You agree to notify us immediately if an Account owner on your Account dies or is
      declared legally incompetent. In the case of an individual Account, if we have reason to believe the Account owner has died
      or has been declared legally incompetent, we may place a hold on the Account to retain funds and refuse to accept deposits
      or to permit withdrawals until we know and have verified the identity of the successor. We will require proof of death or
      adjudication of incompetence. If you die while residing outside the United States, we may require a personal representative
      to be appointed by a court in a United States jurisdiction. Until we receive notice and any required proof of death or
      incompetence, we may act as if all owners are alive and competent. In the event we receive written notice from a personal
      representative, executor, administrator, conservator or guardian purporting to represent you or your estate, we shall be
      entitled to rely on all information supplied and representations made in such written notice to the full extent permitted by
      applicable law. If certain payments originating from government entities are deposited into your Account after your death,
      we may be required to return those payments to the originator upon notice. If we have any tax liability because of paying
      your balance to your estate, the estate will be responsible for repaying us the amount of that tax. If you owe us a debt at
      the time of your death, we are authorized to exercise our right of setoff (our right to apply funds in one account to the debt
      associated with another account) or security interest rights against the funds credited to your balance after your death.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>S. Monitoring and Closing Your Account.</strong> Subject to the terms herein, you can close your Account at any time and for any
      reason by contacting us or terminating the Account through the Service Provider Platform, if applicable. We reserve the
      right to refuse your request to close your Account if your Account is not in good standing or if you have a negative balance
      on your Account. If you intend to close your Account, you should notify us. Simply reducing your Account balance to $0.00
      is insufficient notice. If you close your Account you are responsible for transactions you initiated or authorized, including
      those that we receive after the Account is closed. Withdrawals from your Account may be restricted prior to Account
      closing.
    </p>

    <p>We reserve the right to monitor all Account activity for inappropriate use. We can close your Account at any time, for any
      reason, without advance notice. If we close your Account, we will notify you by mail, electronically or by telephone that we
      have closed your Account unless your Account has had a zero balance for thirty (30) days or more. If we close your Account,
      all collected funds (less any amounts due to us or for debits in process) will be transferred to your Linked Account.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, we may, at our discretion, mail you a check for the available balance in your Account. Written notice that the
      Account has been closed and a check, if any, will be sent to any address shown on our records for you, or if the Account is a
      jointly owned, to any account owner to whom we elect to send it. Once we have closed your Account, you agree that we
      can assess any service charge otherwise applicable against any remaining balance in your Account. We are not responsible
      to you for any damages you may suffer as a result of your Account being closed. If you attempt to make a deposit to an
      Account we closed, we may collect the deposit and set-off your indebtedness to us. Any funds in excess of $1.00 will be
      returned to you.</p>

    <p>State laws (called "escheat" or unclaimed property laws) require us to close your Account and transfer your money to the
      state if your Account is dormant for a period of time as defined by your state of residence. Your Account can become
      dormant if, for 24 months, there is no transactional activity. If your Account becomes dormant, you may no longer receive
      statements, but you can still view your accounts online.</p>

    <p>State abandoned property law establishes guidelines under which unclaimed property must be surrendered to the
      applicable state. Generally, the funds in your Account are considered unclaimed if you have not had any activity or
      communication with us regarding your Account over a period of years, defined by your state of residence. All products
      offered by us are subject to abandoned property laws. If your funds are surrendered to the state, you may be able to
      reclaim them, but your claim may need to be presented to the state. You can avoid the transfer of your money to the state
      simply by signing into your Account, transacting periodically, or contacting us, or replying to any abandoned property
      correspondence.</p>

    <li>Arbitration and Waivers.</li>

    <p>THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW LEGAL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US ARE
      RESOLVED. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION IV (ARBITRATION AND WAIVERS) CAREFULLY. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE
      ARBITRATION PROVISION AS SET FORTH BELOW. If you do not opt out, for a dispute subject to arbitration, neither you nor we will
      have the right to: (A) have a court or a jury decide the dispute; (B) engage in information-gathering (discovery) to the same extent as
      in court; (C) participate in a class action in court or in class arbitration; or (D) join or consolidate a claim with claims of any other
      persons. Arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. The decision of the arbitrator is final
      and binding.</p>

    <p><strong>A. Definitions.</strong> If you have a dispute with us or our Service Provider, and we are not able to resolve the dispute informally,
      you and we agree that upon demand by either you or us, the dispute will be resolved through the arbitration process as set
      forth in this section. A “claim” or “dispute,” as used in this Section IV (Arbitration and Waivers), is any unresolved
      disagreement between you, us and/or our Service Provider, arising from or relating in any way to the Account or these
      Account Terms. The terms “claim” and “dispute” are to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced and
      includes, by way of example and without limitation, any disagreement relating in any way to services offered in connection
      with an Account or any other services offered pursuant to these Account Terms; to your use of any of our banking products
      or services; to any means you may use to access your Account(s); to any advertisements, promotions or oral or written
      statements related to the Account; to the benefits and services related to an Account; or your approval, establishment or
      enrollment for an Account. Claims also include disagreements about the meaning, application or enforceability of this
      arbitration agreement. As solely used in this Section IV (Arbitration and Waivers), “we” or “us” shall include the Bank, its
      affiliates and their successors, employees, directors, officers and agents, and the terms “you” or “yours” shall mean each
      Account owner and all persons or entities approved to have, approved to use and/or given access to an Account. The term
      “Account,” for purposes of arbitration, includes any updated or substitute Account for you.
    </p>

    <p><strong>B. Binding Arbitration and Appeals.</strong> Arbitration applies whenever there is a claim between you and us. If a third party is
      also involved in a claim between you and us, then the claim will be decided with respect to the third party in arbitration as
      well, and it must be named as a party in accordance with the rules of procedure governing the arbitration. No award or
      relief will be granted by the arbitrator except on behalf of, or against, a named party. Claims are subject to arbitration,
      regardless of on what theory they are based, whether they seek legal or equitable remedies, or whether they are common
      law or statutory (Federal or state) claims. Except for small claims addressed in subsection D (Excluded Claims) below,
      arbitration applies to any and all such claims or disputes, whether they arose in the past, may currently exist, or may arise
      in the future.
    </p>

    <p>Judgment upon the arbitrator’s award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator’s decision is final and
      binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA. However, if the amount of the claim exceeds $25,000 or
      involves a request for injunctive or declaratory relief that could foreseeably involve a cost or benefit to either party
      exceeding $25,000, any party can, within thirty (30) days after the entry of the award by the arbitrator, appeal the award to
      a three-arbitrator panel administered by the forum. The panel shall reconsider anew all factual and legal issues, following
      the same rules of procedure and decide by majority vote. Reference in this Section IV (Arbitration and Waivers) to “the
      arbitrator” shall mean the panel if an appeal of the arbitrator’s decision has been taken.</p>

    <p><strong>C. Opting Out.</strong> If you do not want this arbitration provision to apply to your Account, you may opt out by sending us
      written notice of your decision within ten (10) days of the opening of your Account. Such notice must clearly state that you
      wish to cancel or opt out of the arbitration provision of these Account Terms. It should include your name, address, Account
      name, Account number, and your signature and must be mailed to: 2955 Campus Drive #110, San Mateo, CA 94403.
    </p>

    <p><strong>D. Excluded Claims.</strong> You and we retain the right to pursue in small claims court (or an equivalent state court) any dispute
      that is within that court’s jurisdiction, so long as the disputes remain in such court and advance only an individual claim for
      relief. If either you or we fail to submit to binding arbitration of an arbitrable dispute following lawful demand, the party so
      failing shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by the other in compelling arbitration.
    </p>

    <p><strong>E. Initiation of Arbitration.</strong> Any claim must be resolved, upon the election by you or us, by arbitration pursuant to this
      Section IV (Arbitration and Waivers) and the code of procedures of the national arbitration organization to which the claim
      is referred in effect at the time the claim is filed. Claims shall be referred to either Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
      Services (“JAMS”) or the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as selected by the party electing to use arbitration. If a
      selection by us of one of these organizations is unacceptable to you, you have the right within ten (10) days after you
      receive notice of our election to select the other organization listed to serve as arbitrator administrator. For a copy of the
      procedures, to file a claim or for other information about these organizations, contact them as follows: (i) JAMS at 1920
      Main Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 92614; website at www.jamsadr.com; and (ii) AAA at 335 Madison Avenue, New
      York, NY 10017; website at www.adr.org.
    </p>

    <p>In the event that JAMS or the AAA is unable to handle the dispute for any reason, then the matter shall be arbitrated
      instead by a neutral arbitrator selected by agreement of the parties pursuant to the AAA rules of procedure; or, if the
      parties cannot agree, selected by a court in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code)
      (“FAA”). To the extent that there is any variance between the selected forum’s rules and this Section IV (Arbitration and
      Waivers), this Section IV (Arbitration and Waivers) shall control.</p>

    <p>If you initiate the arbitration, you must notify us in writing at: 2955 Campus Drive #110, San Mateo, CA 94403. If we initiate
      the arbitration, we will notify you in writing at your last known address in our file.</p>

    <p><strong>F. Class Action and Jury Waiver.</strong> NEITHER YOU NOR WE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE DISPUTES BY OR
      AGAINST OTHERS IN ANY COURT ACTION OR ARBITRATION, OR TO INCLUDE IN ANY COURT ACTION OR ARBITRATION ANY
      DISPUTE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS, OR TO ACT IN ANY ARBITRATION IN THE INTEREST OF THE
      GENERAL PUBLIC OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY, UNLESS THOSE PERSONS ARE BENEFICIARIES ON YOUR
      ACCOUNT. THIS IS SO WHETHER OR NOT THE CLAIM HAS BEEN ASSIGNED. FURTHER, NEITHER YOU NOR WE SHALL HAVE
      THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A CLAIM IN COURT, SUBJECT TO SUBSECTION D (EXCLUDED CLAIMS), OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON A
      CLAIM, OR TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE CODE OF PROCEDURES OF JAMS OR AAA.
    </p>

    <p><strong>G. Location of Arbitration and Cost.</strong> The arbitration shall take place in the Federal judicial district in which you reside,
      unless the parties agree to a different location in writing. The party initiating the arbitration (or appeal of the first
      arbitration award) shall pay the initial filing fee. If you file the arbitration and an award is rendered in your favor, we will
      reimburse you for your filing fee. If there is a hearing, we will pay the fees and costs for the first day of that hearing. All
      other fees and costs will be allocated in accordance with the rules of the arbitration forum. However, we will advance or
      reimburse filing and other fees if the arbitrator rules that you cannot afford to pay them or finds other good cause for
      requiring us to do so, or if you ask us in writing and we determine in good faith there is a justifiable reason for doing so.
    </p>

    <p>Each party shall bear the expense of their respective attorneys, experts, and witnesses and other expenses, regardless of
      who prevails, but the arbitrator will have the authority to award attorneys and expert witness fees and costs to the extent
      permitted by these Account Terms, the forum’s rules, or applicable law.</p>

    <p><strong>H. Governing Law.</strong> You and we agree that in our relationship arising from these Account Terms: (1) the parties are
      participating in transactions involving interstate commerce; (2) the arbitrator shall decide any dispute regarding the
      enforceability of this arbitration agreement; and (3) this arbitration agreement and any resulting arbitration are governed
      by the provisions of the FAA, and, to the extent any provision of that act is inapplicable, the laws of the State of Tennessee.
      The arbitrator must apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations and
      claims of privilege recognized at law. At the timely request of either party, the arbitrator must provide a brief written
      explanation of the basis for the award.
    </p>

    <p><strong>I. Continuation and Severability.</strong> This Section IV (Arbitration and Waivers) shall survive termination of your Account, these
      Account Terms and any bankruptcy by you or us. If any portion of this Section IV (Arbitration and Waivers) is deemed invalid
      or unenforceable under any principle or provision of law or equity, consistent with the FAA, it shall not invalidate the
      remaining portions of this Section IV (Arbitration and Waivers), these Account Terms or any prior agreement you may have
      had with us, each of which shall be enforceable regardless of such invalidity.
    </p>

    <li>Miscellaneous Terms.</li>

    <p><strong>A. Ordinary Care; No Fiduciary Obligation.</strong> You agree that any act or omission made by us in reliance upon or in
      accordance with any provision of the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the State of Tennessee, or any rule or
      regulation of the State of Tennessee or a federal agency having jurisdiction over the Bank, shall constitute ordinary care.
      Unless otherwise specified, we do not assume any fiduciary obligation on your behalf. This means that we do not act as
      your trustee or financial advisor, and we don't assume any responsibility for your account beyond reasonable care.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>B. Governing Law, Forum and Time Limits.</strong>

      <ol class="agreement-list">
        <li>All Accounts are opened at the Tennessee branch office of the Bank. All actions relating to your Account,
          including these Account Terms, will be governed by the laws and regulations of the United States and the State of
          Tennessee (to the extent that laws of the State of Tennessee are not preempted by Federal law). Federal and the
          laws of the State of Tennessee shall be applied without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.</li>
        <li>To the extent any dispute arising under these Account Terms or relating in any way to your Account or your
          relationship with us is not arbitrated, you consent to the jurisdiction of, and agree that such dispute will be
          resolved by the Federal or state court located in Shelby County, Tennessee.</li>
        <li>You must file any lawsuit or arbitration against us within two (2) years after the claim arises, unless Federal law
          or the laws of the State of Tennessee or an applicable agreement provides for a shorter time. This limit is in
          addition to limits on notice as a condition to making a claim. If Tennessee law does not permit contractual
          shortening of the time during which a lawsuit must be filed to a period as short as two (2) years, you agree to the
          shortest permitted time under Tennessee law. Any action against us must be brought within the period that the
          applicable law requires us to preserve records, unless applicable law or this agreement provides a shorter
          limitation period.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p><strong>C. Reporting Information.</strong> We may report information about your Account to consumer reporting agencies, governmental
      agencies, and/or third-party data services. Defaults on your Account may be reflected in your consumer report.
    </p>

    <p><strong>D. Compliance with Law.</strong> You agree to comply with applicable law and to not use your Account for illegal transactions or
      activities.
    </p>

    <p><strong>E. Changes in Terms.</strong> We may change these Account Terms, or any fees and features of your Account, at any time. We will
      give you advance notice of any change required by law in accordance with such law. We may provide this notice to you on
      or with your statement, by mailing the notice to you directly or by posting the notice on the Service Provider Platform. We
      may change or terminate these Account Terms without notice to comply with any appropriate Federal or state law or
      regulation.
    </p>

    <p><strong>F. Security Interest.</strong> You grant us a security interest in your Account to secure payment of any money that you owe to us
      arising under these Account Terms or any other agreements with us. You acknowledge and grant us the right to use any of
      the funds in your Account to cover any money you owe to us (a “right of set-off”). You agree that the security interests you
      have granted to us are consensual and in addition to any rights of set-off. We may exercise our security interest or right of
      set-off without prior recourse to other sources of repayment or collateral, if any, and even if such action causes you to lose
      interest, incur any penalty or suffer any other consequence. If we exercise our security interest or right to set-off, we will
      notify you to the extent required by applicable law. If the law imposes conditions or limits on our ability to take or set off
      funds in your Account, to the extent that you may do so by contract, you waive those conditions and limits, and you
      authorize us to apply funds as we deem applicable. We may also exercise these rights against any Account beneficiary.
    </p>

    <p>These rights exist no matter who contributed the funds to the Account. We will consider these Account Terms as your
      consent for us asserting our security interest or exercising our right of set-off should any laws governing your Account
      require your consent.</p>

    <p><strong>G. No Waiver of Rights.</strong> If we fail to exercise or waive a right with respect to your Account on one or more occasions, it
      does not mean we have waived, or are obligated to waive, the same right on any other occasion. We may release any other
      person obligated under these Account Terms without affecting your responsibilities under these Account Terms. In any
      event, no such waiver or delay by us is effective unless it is in writing and approved by us.
    </p>

    <p><strong>H. Assignment.</strong> Your Account is not transferable and is not assignable as collateral for a loan or for any other purpose.
    </p>

    <p><strong>I. Other Services and Conflicts.</strong> If we make available to you any of our other banking services offered in connection with
      your Account (e.g., wire or check services), we may provide certain terms and conditions of the additional service to you in
      a separate agreement or disclosure. If a service we offer has a separate agreement, and there is a conflict between the
      terms of these Account Terms and the separate agreement, the separate agreement shall control.
    </p>

    <p><strong>J. Privacy Policy.</strong> You authorize us to share information about you and your Account with our affiliates and third parties,
      unless applicable law or our Privacy Notice prohibits us from doing so. Please see our Privacy Notice for your choices about
      information sharing.
    </p>

    <p><strong>K. Severability.</strong> In the event that any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of these
      Account Terms is illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remainder of these Account Terms shall not be affected thereby. To
      the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties hereto waive any provision of law which prohibits or renders
      unenforceable any provision hereof, and to the extent that such waiver is not permitted by applicable law, the parties
      intend that such provision be interpreted as modified to the minimum extent necessary to render such provision
      enforceable.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>L. Limitation of Liability, Disclaimer of Warranty, Indemnification and Reimbursements.</strong>

      <ol class="agreement-list">
        <li>Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY
          CLAIMS, COSTS, LOSSES, OR DAMAGES RESULTING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM OUR FAILURE TO ACT, OR ANY
          DELAY BEYOND TIME LIMITS PRESCRIBED BY LAW OR PERMITTED BY THESE ACCOUNT TERMS IF SUCH FAILURE OR
          DELAY IS CAUSED BY YOUR NEGLIGENCE, ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THIRD PARTIES, INTERRUPTION OR
          MALFUNCTION OF EQUIPMENT OR COMMUNICATION FACILITIES, SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS BY ANOTHER
          FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, FIRE, NATURAL DISASTERS, ELEMENTS OF NATURE, GOVERNMENT ACTION, ACTS OF
          WAR, TERRORISM OR CIVIL STRIFE, EMERGENCY CONDITIONS, OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND THE
          REASONABLE CONTROL OF THE BANK, PROVIDED THE BANK EXERCISED SUCH DILIGENCE AS THE CIRCUMSTANCES
          REQUIRE. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE BANK SHALL BE EXCUSED FROM SUCH
          FAILURE TO ACT OR DELAY AS LONG AS SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES PREVAIL, AND THE BANK CONTINUES TO USE ITS
          COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO RECOMMENCE PERFORMANCE. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY
          APPLICABLE LAW, OUR LIABILITY TO YOU FOR A CLAIM IS LIMITED TO THE FACE VALUE OF THE ITEM OR
          TRANSACTION, OR THE ACTUAL VALUE OF ANY FUNDS NOT PROPERLY CREDITED OR DEBITED. IN NO EVENT WILL
          WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU ADVISE US OF
          THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</li>
        <li>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any Services or the Service Provider Platform and
          disclaim all warranties, either express or implied or statutory, including, but not limited to, any implied warranties
          of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and lack of viruses related to the Services or the Service
          Provider Platform.</li>
        <li>Indemnification. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any losses, damages, suits and expenses,
          including reasonable attorneys’ fees, which we may incur as a result of: (i) taking any action or not taking any
          action that we are entitled to take pursuant to these Account Terms; (ii) any action or omission by you; or (iii)
          relying upon instructions or information from you.
          This subsection does not, in any case, reduce our liability to you as described in Section VII (Electronic Fund Transfer
          Disclosure).</li>
        <li>Disclaimer. ALL ACCOUNT FEATURES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
          EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
          FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</li>
        <li>Reimbursement for Losses. If we take any action to collect debt incurred by you or other amounts you owe us
          under these Account Terms or defend ourselves in a lawsuit brought by you where we are the prevailing party, you
          agree to reimburse us for our losses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the extent
          permitted by applicable law. We may charge your Account for our losses without prior notice to you.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p><strong>M. Liability for Service Interruptions.</strong> From time to time, due to maintenance, malfunctions or failures of software,
      equipment, or telecommunications devices, as well as unusual transaction volume or similar reasons, access to your
      Account may not be available to you. We minimize the periods of time during which your Account is unavailable. Access to
      your Account may also be interrupted as a result of things beyond our reasonable control, computer failures, loss of power,
      failure or interruption of communication or transportation facilities, riots, strikes, or civil unrest. You agree that we shall not
      be responsible for any loss, damages, costs or expenses that you may suffer or incur, directly or indirectly, as a result of the
      unavailability of access to your Account, regardless of whether it could be shown that we could have prevented or reduced
      the duration of such unavailability by taking any action within our reasonable control. We shall also not be responsible for
      any loss, damages, costs or expenses which you may suffer or incur, directly or indirectly, as a result of your inability to
      access your Account caused directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by your computer or mobile device, your inability to
      establish a connection to or to access the Internet, or other limitations or constraints of the Internet. The provisions set
      forth in this section shall apply in addition to any other provisions in these Account Terms but as applied to service
      interruptions for access to your Account, this section shall control.
    </p>

    <p><strong>N. Section Headings and Successors.</strong> The headings in these Account Terms are only for convenience and do not in any way
      limit or define your or our rights or obligations under these Account Terms. These Account Terms will be binding on your
      personal representatives, executors, administrators, and successors.
    </p>

    <p><strong>O. Change of Address or any Application Information.</strong> You must notify us through the Service Provider Platform of any
      change of address, email address or phone number or any material change to information you provided us in your
      application to open an Account. Any notice we provide to you will be binding and sent to the last (postal or electronic)
      address in our records. We may change your address if we receive an address change notice from the U.S. Postal Service or
      if a company in the business of providing correct addresses informs us that the address in our records no longer matches
      your address.
    </p>

    <p><strong>P. Communications.</strong> You acknowledge that data, including emails, may be accessed by unauthorized third parties when
      communicated between you and the Bank, using the Internet, telephone, or other electronic devices. We are not
      responsible for any misdirected data or disclosures that occur as a result of your use of third-party electronic
      communication channels.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Q. Calls and Messages.</strong> You agree that we or our agents or service providers may contact you regarding any matter for any
      non- telemarketing reason using any kind of telecommunications technology at any email and telephone number you
      provide to us, including the phone number for your mobile device. You agree to receive these calls and messages, including
      pre-recorded or auto-dialed calls. You also agree that we may send text messages to any phone number for your mobile
      device you provide to us. You understand and accept that your service provider may charge you for these calls and
      messages consistent with applicable law. For quality control purposes and for other reasons, you permit us to record and
      monitor your telephone conversations and electronic communications with us (including email). Unless the law requires
      otherwise, you consent in advance to such recording and monitoring and we do not need to remind you of these activities
      at the time of the call or communication. To revoke the consent provided pursuant to this subsection, you must send ten
      (10) days’ prior written notice of such revocation to 2955 Campus Drive #110, San Mateo 94403.
    </p>

    <p><strong>R. Survival.</strong> Termination of these Account Terms shall not impact any right or obligation arising prior to termination, and in
      any event, the parties agree that any right or obligation which, by its nature, should survive termination of these Account
      Terms will survive any such termination (including, but not limited to Sections IV (Arbitration and Waivers) and V
      (Miscellaneous Terms) of these Account Terms).
    </p>

    <li>Tax Reporting and Backup Withholding.</li>

    <p>Federal law requires us to have a valid Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number for each
      Account owner so that we can correctly report the interest you have earned to the relevant tax authorities (if your Account
      is an interest-bearing account). Accordingly, you must certify your Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer
      Identification Number as part of opening an Account. If you do not provide us with and certify a valid Social Security
      Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number within the time period specified, we are required to withhold a
      percentage of the taxable interest that we pay to you. This withholding is commonly referred to as “Backup Withholding.”
      In some states, we may also be required to withhold taxable interest for state taxes.</p>

    <li>Electronic Fund Transfers Disclosure.</li>

    <p>We may offer a variety of electronic banking services for your use with your Account. The purpose of this Section VII
      (Electronic Fund Transfer Disclosure) is to inform you of some of the electronic banking services and also provide you with
      disclosures applicable to the services. We may also provide separate agreements to you that govern the terms of some
      services, including a separate agreement for Cards.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>A. Supported EFTs.</strong> The electronic fund transfers (“EFTs”) that we may support are listed below. EFT available to you will
      depend on the EFTs supported by the Service Provider Platform and all the below listed EFT services may not be available to
      you.

      <ol class="agreement-list">
        <li>Direct deposits of federal government payroll, disability, veteran's benefits, Social Security, and other
          federal government payments that you may receive and that may be deposited to your Account and of your
          paycheck to your Account, provided that your employer offers direct deposit and you complete any forms
          required by your employer.</li>
        <li>Any deposit or withdrawal to your Account that is handled electronically as an ACH Transfer.</li>
        <li>Card transactions at ATMs to withdraw cash, transfer funds and find out balances.</li>
        <li>Card transactions at participating merchants to purchase goods and services. Some merchants may also
          allow you to withdraw cash from your Account while making a purchase.</li>
        <li>Deposit cash and checks by using your Card at an ATM.</li>
        <li>Online fund transfers using your Card and the Service Provider Platform, if available.
          We do not charge for EFTs, but we may add charges at any time by providing you with prior notice if required by law. An
          ATM owner may charge you for using the ATM.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p><strong>B. Transfer Limitations.</strong> The transfer limit depends on the EFT type. If a Card is made available to you, it is subject to a
      purchase and withdrawal limit, as set forth in the debit card agreement governing your Card. The Card may be further
      limited based on fraud risk and security of the Account. All EFTs are subject to limits. Such EFT limits include limits on ATM
      withdrawals, cash advances and PIN or signature-based purchases. ACH Transfers to external accounts are also subject to
      limits on the dollar amount of electronic transfers between your Account and external accounts at other financial
      institutions, including Linked Accounts. All limits described here are designed to be flexible in order to protect the security
      and integrity of the service and accounts, including the Account, as well as you and all other users of the service. These
      limitations may be based on confidential fraud and risk criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the
      protection of you and the integrity of the service and all Accounts and may be modified at our sole discretion without
      advance notice.
    </p>

    <p><strong>C. Preauthorized Credits.</strong> If you have arranged to have direct deposits to your Account at least once every sixty (60) days
      from the same person or company (including your employer), you can call us at +1 (888) 610-2324 or access your Account
      through the Service Provider Platform to find out whether or not the deposit has been made.
    </p>

    <p><strong>D. Periodic Statements.</strong> For purposes of this Section, we may send you a monthly Account statement that sets forth all of
      your EFTs made in the past month, unless there are no EFTs in a particular month. In that case, we will send you a
      statement at least quarterly, unless your account is considered inactive.
    </p>

    <p><strong>E. Terminal Transfers.</strong> If you are able to make transfers to or from your Account using an ATM or point-of-sale terminal,
      you can get a receipt at the time you make any such transfers.
    </p>

    <p><strong>F. Liability for Failure to Make EFTs.</strong> If we do not complete a transfer to or from your Account on time or in the correct
      Amount according to our agreement with you, we will be liable for damages or losses proximately caused by our failure. All
      such damages and losses for a failure to make a transfer will have to be actual proven damages. However, there are some
      exceptions, and we will not be liable for any damages or losses if, for example: (1) there are insufficient funds in your
      Account to complete the transaction through no fault of ours; (2) the funds in your Account are not yet available for use or
      withdrawal; (3) the ATM where you are making the transfer does not have enough cash; (4) the ATM, system, equipment or
      terminal involved in the transfer is not working properly and you know about the improper functioning at the time you
      started the transaction; (5) the funds in your Account are subject to legal process or other encumbrance restricting the
      transfer; (6) the circumstances preventing the transfer or the failure of the transfer is beyond our control (e.g., power
      outage, an Act of God, fire, natural disaster) even after we have taken reasonable precautions; (7) the Account is inactive or
      dormant; or (8) your Card has been revoked due to inactivity or at our discretion. There may be additional exceptions
      stated in our agreement with you or permitted by law.
    </p>

    <p><strong>G. Liability for Unauthorized Transfers.</strong> Tell us AT ONCE if you believe your Card (if one is made available to you) or Credentials have been lost or stolen, or if you
      believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission using information from your Account. You
      could lose all the money in your Account. If you tell us within two (2) business days after you learn of the loss or theft of
      your Card or Credentials, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your Card or Credentials without your permission.
      If you do NOT tell us within two (2) business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Card or Credentials, and we can
      prove we could have stopped someone from using your Card or Credentials without your permission if you had told us, you
      could lose as much as $500.
    </p>

    <p>Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, tell us at once. If you do not tell us within sixty (60) days
      after the statement was mailed to you or first became available via electronic means, you may not get back any money you
      lost after the sixty (60) days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us
      in time. We can extend these time periods if extenuating circumstances (such as a long trip or hospital stay) kept you from
      notifying us.</p>

    <p><strong>H. Business Days.</strong> Our business days are (Monday through Friday) (Monday through Saturday) (any day including Saturdays
      and Sundays). Holidays are (not) included.
    </p>

    <p><strong>I. Confidentiality.</strong> We will disclose information to third parties about your Account or the transfers you make: (1) where it
      is necessary for completing transfers; (2) in order to verify the existence and condition of your Account for a third party,
      such as a credit bureau or merchant; (3) in order to comply with government agency or court orders; or (iv) if you give us
      your written permission.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>J. Preauthorized Payments.</strong>

      <ol class="agreement-list">
        <li>Stop Payment Procedure. You may not stop payment of an electronic transfer that is not recurring once you
          have initiated the transaction. If you informed us, in advance, to make automatic recurring transfers out of your
          Account, you can stop any of these transfers by calling us at [INSERT NUMBER] or sending us an electronic
          communication through the Service Provider Platform. We must receive your stop payment request at least three
          (3) business days before the transfer is scheduled to be made. When you make the request, you must tell us your
          name, the Account to which the transfer is scheduled to be made, specify the exact amount of the transfer you
          want stopped, and the date the transfer is scheduled to be made. If you call us, we may require you to put your
          request in writing and get it to us within fourteen (14) days after you call. If you do not, then your verbal request
          will expire after fourteen (14) days. We will charge you [INSERT AMOUNT] for each stop-payment order you give.</li>
        <li>Notice of Varying Amounts. If these regular payments may vary in amount, the person you are paying must tell
          you ten (10) days before each payment when it will be made and how much it will be. You may choose instead to
          get this notice only when the payment would differ by more than a certain amount from the previous payment, or
          when the amount would fall outside certain limits that you set.</li>
        <li>Liability for Failure to Stop Payment of Preauthorized Transfer. If you order us to stop one of these payments
          three (3) business days or more before the transfer is scheduled, and we do not do so, we will be liable for your
          losses or damages. We will not be responsible if our computer system does not act on your order because you did
          not give us precise and correct information. Our liability for losses or damages may be limited to actual damages
          that you have sustained if the failure to stop payment was due to a bona fide error.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p><strong>K. Error Resolution.</strong> In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Electronic Transfers Telephone us at [insert telephone
      number] Write us at [insert address] [or email us at [insert email address]] as soon as you can, if you think your statement
      or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt. We must hear from
      you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.</p>

    <p>You must provide us with the following information: (1) tell us your name and account number (if any); (2) describe the
      error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need
      more information; and (3) tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.
    </p>

    <p>If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within ten (10) business days.
      We will determine whether an error occurred within ten (10) business days after we hear from you and will correct any
      error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we
      decide to do this, we will credit your Account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will
      have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or
      question in writing and we do not receive it within ten (10) business days, we may not credit your Account. For errors
      involving new Accounts, point-of-sale, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to ninety (90) days to investigate
      your complaint or question. For new Accounts, we may take up to twenty (20) business days to credit your Account for the
      amount you think is in error.</p>

    <p>We will tell you the results within three business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no
      error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation. If
      we credit your Account with funds while investigating an error, you must repay those funds to us if we conclude that no
      error has occurred.</p>

    <li>Deposit Availability Disclosure.</li>

    <p>When a deposit is made to your Account, the funds may not be available immediately. This Section VIII (Deposit Availability
      Disclosure) describes when funds will be made available to you.</p>

    <p><strong>A. Delays.</strong> We may delay the availability of funds from certain types of deposits to your Account. There are exceptions that
      may apply in certain circumstances (e.g., if you have overdrawn your Account repeatedly in the last six months or there is
      an emergency). During the delay, you may not withdraw funds and may not use the funds. Interest will be paid on deposits
      we receive, even if the funds are not yet available for withdrawal. We will notify you if we delay the availability of your
      funds, and we will tell you when you can expect your funds to be available.</p>

    <p><strong>B. Day of Deposits.</strong> Any transaction that you conduct on Saturday, Sunday, a federal holiday, or other days on which we are
      closed will be handled the following business day. If we receive a deposit before 4:00 PM MT on a business day, we will
      consider that business day to be the day of your deposit. However, if we receive a deposit after 4:00 PM MT or on a nonbusiness day, we will consider the deposit as having been made the next business day.</p>

    <p><strong>C. Availability of Cash, Wire and Check Deposits.</strong> If your Account supports cash, wire or check deposits, we will provide
      you with a separate deposit and fund availability disclosure and schedule for such deposits.</p>

    <p><strong>D. Availability of ACH Transfer and EFT Deposits.</strong> Funds from ACH Transfers or EFTs that you initiate through another bank
      will generally be available on the next business day after the day the ACH Transfer is deemed to be received by us. An ACH
      Transfer or EFT debit to a Linked Account or any other external account that we originate on your behalf will generally be
      made available on the third business day after the date the ACH Transfer or EFT is deemed to be received by us. Once they
      are available, you can use the funds for EFTs and ACH Transfers. Even after we have made funds available to you and you
      have withdrawn the funds, you remain responsible if any deposit to your Account is returned, rejected, or otherwise
      uncollected by the Bank.</p>
